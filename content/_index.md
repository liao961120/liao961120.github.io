## About

I share my inspirations here, mostly originating from, or during, the activities
I enjoy. It started as a place for sharing programming-related knowledge and
[open-source projects](#projects) I had worked on. Currently, I also write about
stats, books, and random thoughts.

I began my journey of programming with [R][r] in 2017, and it has ever since
scaffolded my way up in exploring new things. I was excited about the new world
back then and was attracted to other languages. First, it was Python, then
JavaScript and web development. I think I'm now settling down to **R**.
Currently, I use R for my job. In my spare time, I play with stats models in R
and [Stan][stan]. I guess I will keep working with **_statistics_** (hopefully,
for empirical sciences) in the future. 

At times when I feel burned out, I'd go hiking, diving, or travel to
a distant town.


<!-- It wasn't easy to make up my mind about
what I would like to do, partly because programming is a lot of fun.

The world of programming is fascinating because it is creative in nature.
Creation brings about a sense of empowerment, which is addictive. The good part
about creating things is that it motivates exploration. And exploration leads to
learning. The dark side, however, is you might have gone too busy learning,
leaving out of mind the search for an ultimate goal to live for. Hence, you
often get overly excited about new fancy gadgets from the community. Or, maybe
after an epiphany, found that you have lost, or might have never been certain
of, the direction of your life. You believe in the value of programming, deeply.
But you just have no idea of how it helps to create **_meaning_** in life.
