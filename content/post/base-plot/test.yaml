    This paper analyzes the theoretical, pragmatic, and substantive factors that
    have hampered the integration between psychology and psychometrics.
    Theoretical  factors include the operationalist mode of thinking which is
    common throughout  psychology, the dominance of classical test theory, and
    the use of "construct  validity" as a catch-all category for a range of
    challenging psychometric  problems. Pragmatic factors include the lack of
    interest in mathematically  precise thinking in psychology, inadequate
    representation of psychometric  modeling in major statistics programs, and
    insufficient mathematical training in  the psychological curriculum.
    Substantive factors relate to the absence of  psychological theories that
    are sufficiently strong to motivate the structure of  psychometric models.
    Following the identification of these problems, a number of  promising
    recent developments are discussed, and suggestions are made to further  the
    integration of psychology and psychometrics.

  abstract: >-
    Finding causes is a central goal in psychological research. In this paper, I
    argue based on the interventionist approach to causal discovery that the
    search for psychological causes faces great obstacles. Psychological
    interventions are likely to be fat-handed: they change several variables
    simultaneously, and it is not known to what extent such interventions give
    leverage for causal inference. Moreover, due to problems of measurement, the
    degree to which an intervention was fat-handed, or more generally, what the
    intervention in fact did, is difficult to reliably estimate. A further
    complication is that the causal findings in psychology are typically made at
    the population level, and such findings do not allow inferences to
    individual-level causal relationships. I also discuss the implications of
    these problems for research, as well as various ways of addressing them,
    such as focusing more on the discovery of robust but non-causal patterns.

    One of the original aims of this journal was to promote theory in
    psychology. Nowadays more and more psychological researchers are calling for
    more theory development, and articles on the ?theory crisis? have also found
    their way into mainstream journals. In this article, we provide a further
    perspective to this theory debate. Over the past century, philosophy of
    science has staged extensive discussions on the mathematization of nature
    and on the role of mathematics in the development of theory and the
    connection of theory to empirical facts. We show that these discussions are
    highly relevant for the current debate in psychology. In particular, we
    emphasize the importance of conceptual work in the process of
    mathematization, and the role of mathematics in co-ordinating theory and
    observations. We then discuss the implications that these points have for
    statistically oriented psychology in general and for the recent theory
    debate in psychology.

    Meehl argued in 1978 that theories in psychology come and go, with little
    cumulative progress. We believe that this assessment still holds, as also
    evidenced by increasingly common claims that psychology is facing a ?theory
    crisis? and that psychologists should invest more in theory building. In
    this article, we argue that the root cause of the theory crisis is that
    developing good psychological theories is extremely difficult and that
    understanding the reasons why it is so difficult is crucial for moving
    forward in the theory crisis. We discuss three key reasons based on
    philosophy of science for why developing good psychological theories is so
    hard: the relative lack of robust phenomena that impose constraints on
    possible theories, problems of validity of psychological constructs, and
    obstacles to discovering causal relationships between psychological
    variables. We conclude with recommendations on how to move past the theory
    crisis.

    Abstract The scientific goals, values and assumptions of functional and
    cognitive researchers have propelled them down two very different scientific
    pathways. Many have, and continue to argue, that these differences undermine
    any potential communication and collaboration between the two traditions. We
    explore a different view on this debate. Specifically, we focus on the
    Functional-Cognitive (FC) framework, and in particular, the idea that
    cognitive and functional researchers can and should interact to the benefit
    of both. Our article begins with a short introduction to the FC framework.
    We sweep aside misconceptions about the framework, present the original
    version as it was outlined by De Houwer (2011) and then offer our most
    recent thoughts on how it should be implemented. Thereafter, we reflect on
    its strengths and weaknesses, clarify the functional (effect-centric vs.
    analytic-abstractive) level and consider its many implications for cognitive
    research and theorising. In the final section, we briefly review the
    articles contained in this Special Issue. These contributions provide clear
    examples of the conceptual, empirical and methodological developments that
    can emerge when cognitive, clinical, personality and neuroscientists fully
    engage with the functional-cognitive perspective.

    Theories in “soft” areas of psychology lack the cumulative character of
    scientific knowledge. They tend neither to be refuted nor corroborated, but
    instead merely fade away as people lose interest. Even though intrinsic
    subject matter difficulties (20 listed) contribute to this, the excessive
    reliance on significance testing is partly responsible, being a poor way of
    doing science. Karl Popper’s approach, with modifications, would be
    prophylactic. Since the null hypothesis is quasi-always false, tables
    summarizing research in terms of patterns of “significant differences” are
    little more than complex, causally uninterpretable outcomes of statistical
    power functions. Multiple paths to estimating numerical point values
    (“consistency tests”) are better, even if approximate with rough tolerances;
    and lacking this, ranges, orderings, second-order differences, curve peaks
    and valleys, and function forms should be used. Such methods are usual in
    developed sciences that seldom report statistical significance. Consistency
    tests of a conjectural taxometric model yielded 94% success with zero false
    negatives.

    The replication crisis facing the psychological sciences is widely regarded
    as rooted in methodological or statistical shortcomings. We argue that a
    large part of the problem is the lack of a cumulative theoretical framework
    or frameworks. Without an overarching theoretical framework that generates
    hypotheses across diverse domains, empirical programs spawn and grow from
    personal intuitions and culturally biased folk theories. By providing ways
    to develop clear predictions, including through the use of formal modelling,
    theoretical frameworks set expectations that determine whether a new finding
    is confirmatory, nicely integrating with existing lines of research, or
    surprising, and therefore requiring further replication and scrutiny. Such
    frameworks also prioritize certain research foci, motivate the use diverse
    empirical approaches and, often, provide a natural means to integrate across
    the sciences. Thus, overarching theoretical frameworks pave the way toward a
    more general theory of human behaviour. We illustrate one such a theoretical
    framework: dual inheritance theory.

    The development of a theory of mechanistic explanation has been a welcome
    advance over previous theories of explanation, such as deductive nomological
    explanation. However, despite the claims of some supporters of mechanistic
    explanation, not all explanation in cognitive science is or should be
    mechanistic. I defend the claim that functional analysis remains a distinct
    and legitimate form of explanation within cognitive science.
