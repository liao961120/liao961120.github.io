The problem is that I find it quite effortful to externally rotate my left arm. It feels like I was born with some abnormal bone structure that prohibits me from properly rotating my arm, at least this is what I considered highly probable before seeing the PT (physical therapist).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The root giving rise to this problem, after going through several physical therapy sessions, came out to be my inability to properly control and position my left shoulder blade, which probably in the long term led to the weakness in my rotator cuff. Collectively, these issues led me to believe I had a deformed bone structure, which, in reality, constitutes a more intricate and complex combination of problems related to posture, muscular weakness and compensation, and a deficiency in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception">kinesthesia&lt;/a>. It was an exotic experience when, under the guidance of the PT, I first tried to activate my left rotator cuff with the shoulder blade in the correct position. It was extremely difficult, but still, I managed to mobilize and externally rotate my arm slowly. It hurt a lot, and with only three repetitions of the exercise, my arm started trembling and couldn&amp;rsquo;t go further. Nevertheless, it was the first time in my life that I had ever rotated my arm to such an extent using the muscles that my mind was not aware of. My kinesthetic &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space">vector space&lt;/a>, spanned by the muscles I can consciously control, was expanded with another dimension.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-if-subjective-reports-were-all-we-have">What if subjective reports were all we have?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>During the physical therapy sessions, the PT utilized multiple strategies to assess my condition. For instance, I was told to perform certain movements, some of which were resisted by the PT. These assessment methods are highly standardized, and in some sense resemble those conducted by clinical psychologists. However, there is a stark difference&amp;mdash;although both of them involve subjective reports (e.g., I was often asked to report tightness or soreness during the sessions), the PT&amp;rsquo;s assessment is more &amp;ldquo;controlled&amp;rdquo; than many psychological assessments in the sense that there exist some &lt;strong>objective bases&lt;/strong> that allow the assessment to be grounded in the physical world. These objective controls are, for example, the aforementioned assigned movements and the resistance added against them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many psychological assessments, on the other hand, consist purely of subjective ratings. How could this affect the assessment? To illustrate this, let&amp;rsquo;s walk through my physical therapy sessions again but in a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentalism_(psychology)">mentalist&lt;/a> fashion this time. Suppose I went through the therapy sessions just as I mentioned above in the article. The difference, however, is that instead of assessing my condition with the standard PT tools, in this hypothetical scenario, my subjective ratings of &amp;ldquo;how well I could control the rotator cuff&amp;rdquo; were given direct credits, and two of such ratings were collected before and after the sessions respectively. As a guy who had never properly activated his rotator cuff for over a decade prior to therapy, my perception of the rotator cuff was extremely blunted. In fact, it turns out that I erroneously attributed my controlling of the upper trapezius to that of the rotator cuff&amp;mdash;I falsely believed that I had a well-functioning rotator cuff until going through the sessions. As a consequence, I rated my rotator cuff stronger before therapy even though, after going through several weeks of proper training, my rotator cuff functioned better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the previous hypothetical scenario, subjective reports are completely misleading. Thinking carefully through this reveals a subtle assumption&amp;mdash;the mental ruler has to stay the same (i.e., the respondent has to respond to the scale according to identical standards across measurement occasions) for the subjective reports to be valid within this context. However, physical therapy systematically expands my experience and thereby modifies my mental ruler. The subjective reports before and after therapy could therefore &lt;strong>NOT&lt;/strong> be interpreted against a common scale. I broke the assessment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="when-do-psychological-scales-work-well">When do psychological scales work well?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Being told the above story, it might feel as if psychological assessments, predominantly consisting of subjective ratings, are unreliable. Why are they so prevalent then? It&amp;rsquo;s now a good opportunity to look closely at the context and assumptions of these tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Psychological scales, and indeed most psychological studies, explain phenomena at the population level. Therefore, anything has to be interpreted &lt;strong>with reference to a particular population&lt;/strong>. Knowing the score of an individual on a scale explains nothing unless we also have access to a population of scores. This is the &lt;em>psychological&lt;/em> way psychologists use to ground subjective experiences in reality&amp;mdash;by comparing an individual&amp;rsquo;s subjective rating to that of a population. Therefore, the meaning of these psychological scores changes if the reference population has changed&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and we can only vaguely understand a score by learning about this reference population and the items constituting the scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This brings us to the context in which subjective psychological scales are developed and applied. As hinted above, the focus is on the population. Consequently, responses are typically collected from all individuals &lt;strong>ONCE&lt;/strong> in the population of interest. That is, the scales are intended to be administered cross-sectionally. A natural corollary to this is that, since each response&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> comes from a different individual, any two responses are independent. In other words, knowing the score of an individual provides no information about the score of another individual. Compare this to the scenario where the scale is repeatedly applied to collect multiple responses from the &lt;strong>SAME&lt;/strong> individual. Now, the responses collected at different time points are not independent&amp;mdash;knowing that an individual scored, say 30, on the scale last week helps tremendously in predicting his/her score this week. The responses from the same individual at different time points should still be independent, however, when &lt;strong>conditioned on the construct the scale is measuring&lt;/strong>. In simpler terms, when we remove the construct&amp;rsquo;s contribution to the scores, anything left behind should provide no information for predicting any other responses. This is the rationale justifying the application of a scale, originally developed in a cross-sectional context, in a longitudinal setting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So yeah, it seems safe to apply these scales in longitudinal settings as long as the scales are well-developed such that we can measure some construct, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? The problem is that the construct, as understood by the respondents, could change as time passes by. This is particularly likely considering that longitudinal studies often involve some form of &amp;ldquo;treatment&amp;rdquo; in which not only the levels of some latent ability but also the construct itself may change systematically. In the case of my PT example, the &amp;ldquo;treatment&amp;rdquo; involved postural correction and muscular training, which systematically changed and increased my awareness of a set of forgotten muscles. Therefore, my understanding of &amp;ldquo;how well can I control my left rotator cuff&amp;rdquo; changed before and after treatment. Essentially, I was rating my ability to control the left upper trapezius instead of the left rotator cuff prior to treatment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This issue does not arise in cross-sectional settings where each individual responds to the scale only once. In such settings, even if some individuals understand the scale &amp;ldquo;incorrectly&amp;rdquo; (i.e., not as the intended construct the scale is targeting), as long as the bulk of the respondents do so correctly and those who misunderstand do so randomly (e.g., they do not tend to misunderstand in a particular way), the collected scores would still be valid when averaged at the population level. The individuals who misunderstood can be viewed as a source of measurement error, and since the directions of misunderstanding are random, they cancel out at the population level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When scales are developed in a cross-sectional setting, they are tested and validated at the population level (i.e., across individuals). It is thus generally safe to apply these scales in similar cross-sectional settings. On the other hand, since they have never been validated with longitudinal use in mind, it is unclear whether they are still valid in such settings. In such cases, applying the scales longitudinally introduces subtleties such as the above implicit assumption of &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>construct invariance&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, where the &amp;ldquo;mental ruler&amp;rdquo; of an individual is assumed to stay constant across time. Construct invariance is extremely difficult to ensure for purely subjective measures. Nonetheless, the demand for longitudinal applications is still high. How, then, might we maintain construct invariance?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-case-of-educational-assessment">The case of educational assessment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Physical therapy assessments present a case where construct invariance can be more or less maintained by providing objective bases (i.e., assigned movements) for subjective mental rulers to anchor upon. Nevertheless, physical and psychotherapy might differ too much to allow for a good analogy. So let&amp;rsquo;s switch gears to a sister field&amp;mdash;educational assessment&amp;mdash;which also assesses somewhat abstract constructs much like psychology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In educational assessment, the goals are to assess some abilities such as mathematical skills and language proficiency in individuals. The concepts, theories, and analytic frameworks applied to developing assessment instruments for these goals are essentially identical to what psychologists use, such as reliability, validity, classical test theory, item response theory, etc. However, the measurement tools in educational assessment could generally be applied in a longitudinal setting without threatening much of their validity. This is true since they differ from most psychological measurements in that they completely remove subjectivity from scoring&amp;mdash;items in educational assessments are often dichotomously scored (i.e., a response is either correct or incorrect based on some &lt;strong>fixed criteria independent of respondents&amp;rsquo; subjectivity&lt;/strong>). Consequently, as long as factors such as motivation, test-retest biases&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, testing environment, etc. are controlled for, the interpretation of the assessments will be straightforward.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="addressing-subjectivity">Addressing subjectivity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I used to be fascinated with psychologists&amp;rsquo; ideas of measuring abstract constructs through subjective reports. More recently, however, I feel we have been stumbling on subjectivity for too long. Subjective experiences are by nature vague. Vagueness, unfortunately, is detrimental to the progress of science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unless anchored to some criteria, it would be impossible to evaluate subjective experiences. Psychology has traditionally achieved this by anchoring individuals to a population (technically speaking, by introducing probability models). This handy approach is valid until one starts thinking about treatments and repeated measures where the time dimension is incorporated. Subjectivity, a property psychologists cleverly sidestepped by utilizing probabilities and random variations, has resurfaced to mess up our measurements in an era when longitudinal inquiries are most imperative. To deal with subjectivity, we&amp;rsquo;ve got two options.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first option, as hinted throughout the article, is to develop new scales that can at least be partially anchored to some objective bases beyond subjective experiences. In the fields of physical therapy and educational assessment, this is readily achieved because they both have concrete theories pertaining to their areas of focus. Physical therapists know how joints, muscles, and nerves function together to produce proper movements. This body of knowledge is applied directly to develop relevant assessments. Similarly, for developers of math assessments, the knowledge that, say, correctly solving the item $\frac{5 + 3}{4} = ?$ requires proficient skills in addition and division, licenses the measuring of these skills. Conversely, psychologists know very little about the processes bridging constructs to subjective ratings and maybe even less about the constructs themselves, let alone grounding subjectivity in objective bases. The crux of the problem, therefore, lies neither in statistics nor methodologies but in the need for better theories. Psychologists lack good theories to improve measurements, and &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0959354315617253">poor measurements bring about no theory refinement&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second option is to explicitly model the threats to construct invariance by, for instance, introducing additional measures (subjective or not). This would require very strong assumptions and, again, a good theory to clarify the potential intricate interactions among the constructs being measured. These requirements are hard to fulfill in practice since we are left with the current option for the very reason that we lack a good theory in the first place. Nonetheless, it is logically viable to address such threats to construct invariance. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about the assumptions and theories involved, you can take a look at &lt;a href="https://github.com/liao961120/intra">one&lt;/a> such naive analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
&lt;hr>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li id="fn:1">
&lt;p>This is also why evaluating and comparing studies in psychology is difficult. After all, different populations are studied, and therefore statistics such as effect size measures cannot be directly compared across studies unless strong assumptions and additional efforts are made to ensure the comparability of the populations.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:2">
&lt;p>Or more precisely, each &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>set of responses&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; since there may be multiple items (and thus multiple responses) collected from a scale administered to an individual.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:3">
&lt;p>I coined this term by borrowing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_invariance">measurement invariance&lt;/a>. The two terms are conceptually similar, but measurement invariance focuses on groups (e.g., invariance across gender or cultural groups) whereas &amp;ldquo;construct invariance&amp;rdquo; here emphasizes invariance across measurement occasions &lt;strong>within the same individual&lt;/strong>. In addition, measurement invariance is usually discussed in abstract statistical terms. On the other hand, &amp;ldquo;construct invariance&amp;rdquo; is introduced to help clarify the underlying process. We are thinking &lt;a href="https://yongfu.name/2023/02/25/irt1/#simulating-item-responses">forward&lt;/a> to reason about under what conditions (i.e., assumptions) the process generates data that can be analyzed consistently across both longitudinal and cross-sectional settings.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:4">
&lt;p>The memory of items seen in previous assessments is one such example. In educational assessment, this is usually controlled by using parallel forms (different versions of the same assessment or test) in retests.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

R Markdown (and Quarto) is great, especially when the written piece involves a lot of code, but I often found it more efficient to split between the tasks of programming and writing (e.g., plotting with external scripts and then referencing the charts in the document). Furthermore, Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s functionality is sufficient for my needs. In fact, I sometimes find Pandoc too powerful&amp;mdash;once in a while, I come across some Pandoc options providing solutions to things I have dealt with some hacky javascript.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ironically, powerful tools could result in inefficiency for novices, probably through the joint effect of memory limitation and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice">the paradox of choice&lt;/a>. We constantly forget useful features and have difficulties deciding the best way to implement a feature when there are multiple routes to achieve the goal. The syntax of Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown is well-designed to specifically address some of the incompatibilities between HTML and LaTeX. However, just like all flavors of Markdown, Pandoc is also lenient about its syntax. Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s seductive for novices to mix Markdown with HTML, say when writing a blog post, and with LaTeX when targeting paged media. Repercussions become visible when you want to compile works, originally targeted at either the web or printing, into another format.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The theme here is not minimalism in terms of a modest parsimonious set of Markdown features. Rather, I believe minimalism can be approached by picking a powerful tool, much more powerful than what one demands at the beginning, sticking to it, and mastering it. A powerful tool provides overarching principles and conventions that can only be visible and beneficial once one has mastered it. Sticking to these conventions saves the experienced from information overload, and they could instead focus on getting things done. This, I think, is the essence of minimalism. Any effort not directly invested into documenting and conveying ideas (e.g., worries about formatting, typesetting, visual appearance, etc.) acts against minimalism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typesetting does help convey ideas, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it, one might ask. I totally agree, and it does so by following a particular set of conventions. That&amp;rsquo;s why journal publishers provide style guides and templates. A consistent style helps readers quickly grasp the messages in the papers. The problem is that authors often invest too much in typesetting, slowing down the writing process. Typesetting should be automated given its highly repetitive nature. And to automate the process, authors need to obey another set of conventions. Since the typesetting requirements of the final written products (e.g., printed books and fancy blog posts) are often quite complicated, the set of conventions for writing the source documents must also be large enough for typesetting to be automatable. This is why we need a powerful tool to provide the conventions in the first place. This is also why LaTeX has been prevalent among heavy writers&amp;mdash;as long as one sticks to paged media, LaTeX can pretty much compile to any format on demand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nowadays, we often find it necessary to convert our works into both HTML and PDF. Pandoc is THE ideal tool for this, to the best of my knowledge. Given the highly incompatible nature of HTML and LaTeX styling, Pandoc does a great job of providing a common set of representations to be converted into native HTML and LaTeX elements. Whenever Pandoc does not provide such a representation, it signals that one might be asking too much. It is then a good time to rethink whether we indeed need the element, whether we require both HTML and PDF outputs, and whether we can afford additional efforts for typesetting both output formats. Luckily, I rarely find it necessary to go beyond what Pandoc has provided. With citation and bibliography provided by Pandoc &lt;a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations">citeproc&lt;/a> and cross-referencing provided by &lt;a href="https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref">pandoc-crossref&lt;/a>, I have no problem writing papers and books that compile into both HTML and PDF. Instead, what I find tricky is Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s overwhelming options. It would be very inefficient to look up the options every time one decides to write something. So I finally decided to document my workflow and conventions of writing with Pandoc&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="figure">Figure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Figures create no issue at all as long as one sticks to PNGs or JPEGs. I love vector graphics, however. In addition, I often draw graphs with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ">TikZ&lt;/a> that output to PDFs. It thus seems natural for me to include those PDFs as figures in my work to be compiled as a PDF document. What to do then, for the HTML outputs?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer lies in the mighty option &lt;a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--default-image-extension">&lt;code>--default-image-extension&lt;/code>&lt;/a>. Basically, in my source document, most image links are written &lt;strong>without&lt;/strong> the image extension. For instance, instead of &lt;code>![](fig/foo.pdf)&lt;/code>, I use &lt;code>![](fig/foo)&lt;/code> and set &lt;code>--default-image-extension=pdf&lt;/code> when I&amp;rsquo;m compiling to PDF. If I want an HTML output, I would simply call Pandoc with &lt;code>--default-image-extension=svg&lt;/code>, and Pandoc will locate the &lt;code>.svg&lt;/code> version of the figures in &lt;code>fig/&lt;/code> for me. No modification to the source document. To sum up, my figure workflow follows something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Create graphics from individual &lt;code>.tex&lt;/code> documents, R scripts, or anything else in a &lt;code>fig/&lt;/code> directory.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For PDF graphics, I convert them into &lt;code>.svg&lt;/code> with my custom wrapper function &lt;a href="https://yongfu.name/stom/reference/pdf2png.html">&lt;code>stom::pdf2svg()&lt;/code>&lt;/a> around &lt;a href="https://inkscape.org">Inkscape&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For SVG graphics, I convert them into &lt;code>.pdf&lt;/code> with a similar function &lt;code>stom::svg2pdf()&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For graphics of other formats (e.g., &lt;code>.png&lt;/code>, &lt;code>.jpg&lt;/code>, etc.), I keep them as is, and specify their paths &lt;strong>with extensions&lt;/strong> in the source documents.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reference the graphics &lt;strong>without extensions&lt;/strong> in the image links except for those that only have a &lt;code>.png&lt;/code> or &lt;code>.jpg&lt;/code> version.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Setup two different commands or scripts for compiling the HTML and PDF outputs, respectively.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For the command compiling to HTML, the option &lt;code>--default-image-extension=svg&lt;/code> is applied.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For the command compiling to PDF, the option &lt;code>--default-image-extension=pdf&lt;/code> is used.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="heading">Heading&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I am accustomed to using level-2 headings (&lt;code>##&lt;/code>) as the top-level heading when writing posts and articles. This makes Pandoc produce HTMLs that follow the conventions of web pages&amp;mdash;one &lt;code>h1&lt;/code> tag per HTML file. But things go wrong when you compile the document into PDFs (through &lt;code>LaTeX&lt;/code> engines), especially when section numbering is enabled. In the output PDF, the top-level headings will be missing. If you turn on section numbering, you will see that the level-2 headings are given numbers starting with &lt;code>0.&lt;/code>. To address the inconsistency, take a look at the option &lt;a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--shift-heading-level-by">&lt;code>--shift-heading-level-by&lt;/code>&lt;/a>. By setting &lt;code>--shift-heading-level-by=-1&lt;/code> for PDF outputs, I can adjust the heading levels in the output PDFs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="citation">Citation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Pandoc has native support for generating citations and bibliography when the &lt;a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations">&lt;code>--citeproc&lt;/code>&lt;/a> option is used. Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citation-syntax">citation syntax&lt;/a> is well-documented in its manual so I won&amp;rsquo;t repeat it here. Another thing worth noting is the reference management software &lt;a href="https://www.zotero.org">Zotero&lt;/a> and its extension &lt;a href="https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex">BetterBibTex&lt;/a>. We need them for customizing citation keys in the bibliography, which eases the process of citing works during writing. Search the internet for &lt;code>Pandoc + Zotero&lt;/code> and you will find many resources with details. For example, take a look at this &lt;a href="https://github.com/laderast/magic-of-markdown/blob/master/pandoc-zotero/notes.md">document&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cross-reference">Cross-reference&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cross-referencing consists of a set of complicated functionalities. Many tools have been created for this task. For instance, in the R Markdown ecosystem, Bookdown introduces its own &lt;a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/cross-ref.html">crossref syntax&lt;/a>. Quarto has also developed another set of &lt;a href="https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html">crossref syntax&lt;/a> through Lua filters. Both of them build on&amp;mdash;but go much more beyond&amp;mdash;Pandoc. Using them thus requires familiarity with their ecosystems. A more Pandoc-centric solution is the &lt;a href="https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref">pandoc-crossref filter&lt;/a>. To use &lt;code>pandoc-crossref&lt;/code>, one simply download an executable from GitHub and place it in one of the PATH directories. Specifying &lt;code>--filter=pandoc-crossref&lt;/code> when calling Pandoc would then enable cross-referencing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>pandoc-crossref&lt;/code>&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://lierdakil.github.io/pandoc-crossref/">documentation&lt;/a> is well-written. Be patient and take some time to read it. Personally, I find the functionalities quite overwhelming, so I wrap the configuration variables in an external &lt;a href="https://github.com/liao961120/stom/blob/main/inst/template/pandoc-crossref.yaml">YAML file&lt;/a> as described &lt;a href="https://lierdakil.github.io/pandoc-crossref/#settings-file">here&lt;/a>. A minor thing to notice is &lt;code>--filter=pandoc-crossref&lt;/code> should be &lt;strong>called before&lt;/strong> &lt;code>--citeproc&lt;/code> to avoid some potential issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="inline-formatting">Inline formatting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Pandoc provides various &lt;a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#inline-formatting">inline formattings&lt;/a> that convert nicely to LaTeX and HTML elements, such as &lt;em>emphasis&lt;/em>, &lt;em>strikeout&lt;/em>, &lt;em>superscripts and subscripts&lt;/em>, &lt;em>verbatim&lt;/em> (inline code), &lt;em>underline&lt;/em>, &lt;em>small caps&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>highlighting&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a mixed feeling when I first learned about the small caps feature. I was excited but also regretted not looking up the small-cap feature because I had just used the tex command &lt;code>\textsc{}&lt;/code> in a previous article. Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s cool that &lt;code>[text]{.smallcaps}&lt;/code> gets converted to &lt;code>\textsc{text}&lt;/code> for LaTeX and to &lt;code>&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;smallcaps&amp;quot;&amp;gt;text&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/code> for HTML. Many other features can similarly save you from mixing markdown with LaTeX/HTML syntax. Always be patient to read the documentation (reminding myself)!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Given the tremendous amount of options required to compile a Pandoc Markdown document into outputs fitting my taste, I realized I had to wrap the massive Pandoc command into some functions. Therefore, I included &lt;a href="https://yongfu.name/stom/reference/pandoc_pdf.html">two functions&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/liao961120/stom/tree/main/inst/cli">several CLI scripts&lt;/a> in my personal package &lt;code>stom&lt;/code> to help me with these massive commands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For instance, to compile a Markdown file into a PDF, I can simply call:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span style="white-space:pre;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">1&lt;/span>&lt;span>pandoc_pdf writing-conventions.md
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>which generates this monstrous command under the hood:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>下方是我看完電影後的理解與詮釋，內容基本上已經含蓋了重要的劇情。這部電影其實不怕劇情雷，但很怕詮釋雷，所以強烈建議在未看過電影前不要閱讀下方內容。&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>前一陣子看了兩次《豬殺令》，在腦袋中又反芻了無數次，真的超愛這部電影！仔細思索故事內容時，發覺這部電影跟《高年級實習生》有些類似，編導似乎都想將心目中的「理想人格」，呈現在片中的主角——我覺得《高年級實習生》的 Ben 以及《豬殺令》的 Robin 分別就是兩部電影中的理想人格。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>在《豬殺令》中，Robin 看似是一個與社會脫節的「怪人」。他隱居在山中的簡陋小屋、不修邊幅、靠著採集松露為生。採到的松露不是拿去賣錢，而是透過以物易物的方式跟中盤商 Amir 交換生活必需品 (多數為食物)。Robin 下山去尋找他被綁架的松露豬時的各種場面，看起來就像是個不可理喻的瘋子，世間的「道理」(例如，松露豬不見再買一隻就好)、城鎮內部運作的「潛規則」(例如，某人權勢很大你惹不起) 都無法阻攔 Robin 尋找他的豬。原因很簡單，因為 Robin 不是為了採集松露才需要豬，他是因為愛那隻豬才需要她。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Robin 這角色所體現的是那些&lt;strong>對自己非常誠實、堅毅地相信自己的價值並且依循這些價值而行動的人&lt;/strong>，所以他看起來會與這個社會格格不入——不是因為 Robin 很「怪」，而是因為他太真實而這個社會太虛偽了；他知道社會上有太多所謂的「道理」與「規則」並非源自人們最真摯的自己，有太多時候，人們為了依循社會認為的「合理」而對自己內心深處最真實的感受視而不見。所以，Robin 才會對以前被他開除的廚師 Derek 說出這段醍醐灌頂的話
(Derek 年輕時想開酒吧，但最後服膺於社會價值，封閉了這理想而選擇開了能賺錢與累積名聲的高級餐廳)：&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>They’re not real. You get that, right?&lt;br>
None of it is real.&lt;br>
The critics aren&amp;rsquo;t real…&lt;br>
the customers aren&amp;rsquo;t real…&lt;br>
because this isn&amp;rsquo;t real.&lt;br>
You aren&amp;rsquo;t real. &lt;br>
&lt;br />
Derek, why do you care about these people?&lt;br>
They don&amp;rsquo;t care about you, none of them.&lt;br>
They don&amp;rsquo;t even know you because you haven&amp;rsquo;t shown them.&lt;br>
&lt;br />
Every day, you wake up and there&amp;rsquo;ll be less of you.&lt;br>
You live your life for them, and they don&amp;rsquo;t even see you.&lt;br>
You don&amp;rsquo;t even see yourself.&lt;br>
We don&amp;rsquo;t get a lot of things to really care about.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>在故事後半段時，Robin 說服 Darius (綁架豬的主使者，也是 Amir 的父親) 說出豬的下落時，也完全依循著自己所擁抱的價值。Robin 第一次去找 Darius 理論時，Darius 只想用錢打發他，完全不告訴他豬的下落、不願意敞開心胸與他對話。多年前 Darius 與妻子曾吃過 Robin 煮的一頓晚餐，那晚他和妻子非常開心，菜餚的美味讓他們即使多年後依舊時常提到這頓晚餐。後來，Darius 的妻子因自殺未遂成為植物人長年臥床，Darius 或因妻子或因事業，也變得冷淡、強悍、變成情感的絕緣體。Robin 透過 Amir 知道了這些事，也清楚地記得自己當年為他們做過菜 (這件事反映 Robin 是多麼熱愛自己廚師的工作——他記得自己煮過的每一頓飯以及服務過的每一位客人)。於是，Robin 決定為 Darius 做他和妻子當年吃過的那頓飯——Darius 嚐了主菜，喝了紅酒&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;這些熟悉的味道喚起了當年的記憶，跟隨記憶而來的是汩汩湧出的強烈情感。在感受到壓抑多年後湧出的情感，Darius 與 Robin 終於能站在同一個平台上對話。此刻的 Darius 才真正感受到 Robin 真誠而簡單的動機——對豬的愛，就如同自己對於妻子的愛一樣。在這些誠懇真實的情感之下，世俗的規則、利益、權勢、面子、似是而非的理由&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;都顯得微不足道，唯一重要的是以真相回應 Robin 的真誠。然而不幸的是，真相是 Robin 的豬在被綁架的過程中受傷身亡了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Robin 得知豬死掉之後的最後這段劇情又將故事的層次推高了一層。整個故事中，可以看到 Robin 是一個對自己非常誠實的人，但即便誠實如 Robin，仍有不願直視、不願面對的真相。Robin 這十五年來會躲進山中隱居，就是因為妻子的逝去。他離開與妻子共同生活的城鎮，好遠離各種觸景傷情。對於妻子的情感，則轉而寄託於他的松露豬上。為了尋找被綁架的豬，Robin 被迫回到原本生活的城鎮，在這個過程中，他其實也正慢慢地、下意識地開始面對失去妻子的傷痛 (例如，發覺故居院子中的柿子樹已然不在，一旁的孩子問他說樹是死掉了嗎)。在故事接近尾聲時，Amir 與 Robin 坐在小餐館裡，Robin 仍對於豬的死去無法釋懷，碎念著：“If I never came looking for her, in my head, she’d still be alive.”，而 Amir 的一句話點醒了 Robin： “But she wouldn’t be.”。正是這句話讓 Robin 意識到豬的死去已是事實，一項他無論如何幻想也無法改變的真相。他必須懷著這份傷痛，才能真實地活在這個世上。在意識到並接受自己永遠失去豬的同時，Robin 也終於接受了自己永遠失去了妻子的事實。&lt;/p>

&lt;p>由於湯是自己煮出來的，在品嚐時，便較能將湯中 (原本無法察覺) 的各種味道對應至原材或是烹飪步驟——「香菇似乎放太多了，蓋去辣椒以及雞肉的味道」、「味道有些失和，似乎酸味多了點，或許剝皮辣椒的醃汁能少加一點」、「整體香氣不足，或許雞腿得再煎焦一點、香菇得再煸久一點」。
這些經驗與連結也能帶到其他人煮的剝皮辣椒雞湯上。因此，品嚐剝皮辣椒雞湯不再只是欲望的滿足與消退，現在多了更持久、更有意義的東西——首先，我可能意識到這碗雞湯超好喝，根據湯裡的料或味道我或許可以推測出它好喝的原因、它比自己做的「多」出了什麼、它如何完美調和各種食材的味道；也或許，憑我自己無法得出湯好喝的秘訣。這時，我可能需要向做出這碗湯的人討教才得以解惑。在此，我開始對背後產出這碗湯的一切感到興趣了，雞湯不再只是喝的好爽而已，裡頭更濃縮著活生生的人所投注的精神以及一代代傳承下來的知識經驗。湯 (以及任何非生產線做出來的東西) 是人的延伸。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>後來才驚覺，這不就是異化的概念嗎XD 透過做飯真的學到好多東西啊😂&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Despite knowing the journey&lt;br>
and where it leads,&lt;br>
I embrace it.&lt;br>
And I welcome every moment of it.&lt;br>
&lt;span style="font-size:0.85em">&amp;mdash; Arrival (2016)&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>電影《異星入境》中，主角 Louise 即使能預見未來女兒會因罕見疾病而早逝，也知道丈夫會因此而離開，她仍然選擇走上這條路，不去更改她早已預知的未來。為什麼？&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我起初認為是因為與女兒相處的經驗太過珍貴，讓 Louise 寧願面對失去的疼痛也不願犧牲掉這些&lt;strong>更&lt;/strong>美好的經驗。後來發現，這解釋背後其實有個非常大的假設&amp;mdash;正向經驗比起負向經驗來得「重要」，理性的人們應該會追求「正向 - 負向 &amp;gt; 0」的人生。後來有些長進之後，才發現這個假設應該恰恰與 Louise 的信念完全相反。我想 Louise 相信的是，各種經驗都&lt;strong>同等&lt;/strong>珍貴，不論是歡喜、悲痛、迎接新生命還是面對生命的消亡。即使是心碎之下，還是有感激的時刻。而她是在看遍自己的一生之後，才得出這個結論的。她選擇去用心擁抱生命賜予她的每一個時刻。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>或許最難以理解的是，擁抱負面經驗的意義何在？一個合理的解釋是，「辛苦過後的果實最甜美」，光明需要有黑暗的對比才顯得珍貴，所以負面經驗是為了襯托正面經驗才有意義。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>但我覺得不僅是如此。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>擁抱負面經驗&lt;strong>本身就是有意義&lt;/strong>的。透過這類經驗，我們才能體會到自己的渺小、才能夠謙遜；透過細心品嚐自己的痛苦，我們才能學會擁抱自己，也才能真正理解別人的苦痛、才有辦法同理他人。這些經驗本身雖然不愉快，但正是因為這些經驗，生命才能有溫度，我們才能感受到活著的感覺。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>然而，社會與家庭告訴我們的，往往是相反的。我們被鼓勵去擁抱「好」的經驗，去避開「不好」的狀態。在我們能真正平等去感受各種經驗之前，早已根深柢固地認為只有正向經驗才可能有意義，負向經驗只會帶來傷害，一遇到就要趕緊逃開、脫離這種狀態。有時候甚至認為自己處在負面狀態時是&lt;strong>不道德&lt;/strong>的，因為這會帶給親友困擾。然而實際的情況是，越是迴避負面經驗，我們越可能因此受害，而這正是&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_avoidance">經驗性迴避&lt;/a> (Experiential Avoidance) 告訴我們的事情。這概念是指人們企圖去避免感受特定經驗的傾向，例如，面對負面的想法、記憶、情緒以及身體感受時，人們常會去壓抑它們以避免經驗到這些感受。但這麼做卻會帶來更大的傷害。例如，因為失去孩子太過痛苦而透過酒精與藥物麻痺自己的感受；因為認知到自殺念頭的可怕而拼命壓抑它，反而更容易擔心自殺 (白熊效應) (Hayes et al., 1996)。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>與經驗性迴避相反的概念是接納 (Acceptance)。舉例來說，在面對負向情緒時，接納是去&lt;strong>不帶評價地&lt;/strong>接受自己正處在情緒下，並仔細感受情緒，擁抱當下的感覺，而不去嘗試擺脫它。如果感到悲傷，就好好感受悲傷；如果感到憤怒，就好好感受憤怒
&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>。能做到接納，才有辦法平等地面對與擁抱生命裡的各種經驗。而要做到接納，前提是要能盡量不帶評價地面對眼前的事實。所以，在接納的概念裡，本就&lt;strong>沒有好與壞&lt;/strong>，接納就是用人事物原本的樣貌去理解人事物。也因此，接納本身就蘊含著&lt;strong>平等&lt;/strong>的概念，我們無法只接納「好」的而不去接納「不好」的，因為在分辨好壞的同時，我們就已經下了評價，我們就在透過濾鏡看著扭曲的世界，我們就無法如實地體驗活著的感覺。&lt;/p>

&lt;p>重要的是去「感受」而不是被「自動化的思考」拉著走，因為這些自動化的思考時常帶著強烈的評價，例如，「你不&lt;strong>應該&lt;/strong>感到生氣」、「哭出來&lt;strong>好羞恥&lt;/strong>」、「悲傷不能&lt;strong>解決問題&lt;/strong>」。&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>今天來分享一部電影《命運規劃局》。以前看的時候，說不上為什麼但就覺得很好看 (或許是因為 Elise 的性感英國腔？)，但實在也找不出什麼深刻的東西。直到前陣子重看，才發覺「哇！用這種方式去解讀電影，電影變得比太魯閣峽谷還深刻」。(大雷警告，下段劇情簡述)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David 十歲時就失去了母親與哥哥，不久之後也失去了父親。受到父親的影響 (偶像是甘迺迪) ，David 從小便有了從政的夢想。從政之後，他也發現自己熱愛這個行業，他享受站在人群面前，這似乎可以讓他忘卻十歲以來就伴隨著自己的空虛感與寂寞。David 透過群眾對他的喜愛來填補自己所失去的家人的愛。直到他遇到了 Elise，他發現只要跟她在一起，他就滿足了，不再需要透過眾人的喜愛來填補內心的空虛。命運規劃局 (其實就是上帝 + 天使組成的集團) 認為如果 David 與 Elise 在一起，就會改變規劃局要 David 未來成為總統的計畫，因而百般阻撓兩人交往。&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption>電影&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>這部電影用了普通人最容易理解的方式來呈現 David 心中的孤獨，就是透過愛情初期的那種非常美好的感受來進行對比。不過我覺得比較有趣的是以更廣博的「愛」去理解電影。如此一來，這裡指涉的愛，便包含了 David 成長過程中未能得到的家人的愛。而 David 與命運規劃局的拉扯，其實就呈現了 (當代) 人們認為最重要的兩項東西「愛」與「成就」之間的拉扯&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;今天你有了足夠的「愛」，你就不需要「成就」來填補心中的空虛；反過來說，今天你想要有「成就」，你就應該對「愛」有所節制，因為它會阻撓你專注在事業上。這某種程度上可以說是規劃局理解世界的邏輯，然後很驚人地，主流社會似乎也以同樣的邏輯在理解這件事。譬如說，父母可能會不敢表露出對小孩的愛 (還是只有亞洲父母？？？)，因為擔心這樣會「寵壞」小孩，會讓小孩變得無法獨立自主&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>。有些人則擔心表露出太多愛，會讓對方耽溺在愛的美好之中，而不願脫離舒適圈去面對外部世界的挑戰。簡言之，這個邏輯認為&lt;strong>愛使人軟弱&lt;/strong>。這種感覺也是我在第一次聽到無條件正向關懷 (unconditional positive regard)&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> 的概念時有過的疑惑。不過直到終於體會到健康的愛所能帶來的不可思議的安定感，以及社會上的許多人未曾經驗這種感受之後，我才終於能跳出這邏輯，重新看待這件事。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>一個我覺得比較好的方法，是以馬斯洛的需求金字塔去理解這件事。如果我們有足夠的愛 (這邊的愛是指無論我做錯了什麼，或是我被老師上司同事同學甚至路人甲討厭，我都知道有那麼幾個對我真正重要的人，他們不會因此就不愛我了)，我們就能有非常穩健的根基去面對世界帶來的艱困挑戰，因為我們內心深處知道，我可以放膽去做而不用害怕失敗。因為即使失敗了，我背後還是有愛我的人能夠接住我，願意陪伴我一同面對這艱困的世界。因為我已經擁有世界上&lt;strong>最珍貴&lt;/strong>的東西了，失敗所帶來的打擊，相比之下顯得微不足道。在這個概念之下的「愛」，是一股&lt;strong>使人茁壯&lt;/strong>的安穩力量，是一個人在面對任何艱困挑戰的先決條件。有了這強固的根基，才能夠在需要時，心無旁鶩地面對挑戰。沒有了愛，我們無法知道在失敗之後，有無能力繼續面對這個世界。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>愛使人軟弱的概念，想起來真的蠻可怕的。有時候，我們並不是沒有人愛，而是因為我們對於愛 (使人軟弱) 的認知，導致沒有人願意大方承認，進而造成我們無法感受到自己被愛著。即使客觀上真的沒有人愛我了 (例如，我成為了世界上最老的老頭，但因太過孤僻沒有持續交朋友，導致現在沒有任何朋友)，我同樣能以愛別人的方式來&lt;strong>愛自己&lt;/strong>，愛自己的所見所聞、愛自己的感受、愛自己即使經歷那麼多狗屁倒灶的事卻依然撐了下去、愛自己生而為人，生而為一個生命的本來面目。「愛使人軟弱」的概念，則可能會摧毀我們自愛的能力，因為我們相信自愛只會讓自己耽溺在舒適圈中，讓自己越陷越深。一旦失去自愛的能力，就無法對自己寬容，無法對自己寬容，任何的挫折與失敗，即使再小，都能將自己擊潰。&lt;/p>

&lt;p>我覺得這對也不對。不過造成小孩能否獨立自主關鍵應該在於「如何」愛小孩，而不是「愛」本身的結果。告訴小孩我愛你不等同於我會替你承擔所有事。你還是有你該負的責任，我愛你是我願意陪著你一起面對你該負的責任，但不是讓你可以免去這些責任。&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

不過這裡要來推薦的不是超粒方，而是&lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ivo%E5%BF%83%E7%90%86%E5%90%A7/id1576374600">一個 Podcast 頻道&lt;/a>。這個頻道對於&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadland_(film)">《遊牧人生》&lt;/a>這部電影的一些&lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep01-%E4%BD%A0%E4%B9%9F%E6%98%AF%E5%80%8B%E7%95%B0%E9%84%89%E4%BA%BA%E5%97%8E-%E5%BF%83%E7%90%86%E4%BA%BA%E8%81%8A-%E6%B8%B8%E7%89%A7%E4%BA%BA%E7%94%9F/id1576374600?i=1000528751157">體悟與反思&lt;/a>，對我很有啟發而且也非常令人感動。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>當初在看《遊牧人生》時，看到快睡著，但聽完這 podcast (的 pre-release 版) 時相當感動。Podcast 接近尾聲時，觸碰到了作為一個人的意義 (或者說，一個人死掉之後，還能有意義嗎) 的問題。後來仔細一想，發現這裡的想法跟&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wick">《捍衛任務》&lt;/a>裡 John Wick 強烈的求生意志以及&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_(2017_film)">《可可夜總會》&lt;/a>都能有所連結。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>這邊最令我感動的地方是&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>意識到一個人即便已經死亡消逝，他仍能存活於在世之人的腦袋中。這種存活，不光只是被「記著」而已。亡者在世時與人相處的所言所行、人格個性、興趣想法精神&amp;hellip;這些都會慢慢滲入並整合成為對方的一部分。透過這種方式，即使一個重要的人已經逝去，他仍然作為我們的一部分，持續地影響我們、幫助我們、與我們一同面對生活的種種。他的身體已然消失，但他最重要的部份&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;心靈，依然透過我們而持續存活於這個世界。&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="內容懶人包-原文寫得好多了">內容懶人包 (原文寫得好多了)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>面對這個困難的世界，我們常常用各項「目標 (goals)」引導自己前進—考進理想學校、找到好工作 (我的志願是成為OO)、於學習或工作上取得成就、交往結婚、養育子女、存錢買房、去十個國家旅遊……有目標固然很好，但如果僅依靠目標來引導生活卻未深思目標背後的意義 (為何我會想達成這個目標？為何這個目標對我來說很重要？)，那總有一天，當目標都一一完成了，或是更不幸的，當目標太難以致無法達成時，此時我們要如何維持動力？如何不迷失人生方向？&lt;/p>
&lt;p>「核心價值 (values)」是比目標更深層的東西，是指對自己 (而非他人或社會) 重要並且能賦予目標及生活意義的東西。它就像是個羅盤，能夠指出我們前進的方向；但同時，它不是目標，不會有被完成被劃掉的一天，也不會有達不達得到的問題，因而能一直為我們指出前進的方向。根據核心價值行動，縱使無法達成某個特定的目標，我們也不會太過氣餒，因為條條大路通羅馬，永遠有其它符合核心價值的目標可以嘗試，也因為知道自己一直在往理想的方向前進，所以不會為無法達成一個目標而覺得空忙一場。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="自我探索的困境">自我探索的困境&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>探索核心價值並不是件容易的事情。個人的核心價值之所以難以釐清，一方面或許可以歸因於我們太過於目標導向的思維習慣；另一方面，要能區分社會期待以及核心價值的差別，也需要足夠的經驗與時間探索。對於如何從茫茫的各種可能中釐清自己的核心價值，一個可能的切入點或許是興趣。這邊的興趣是指需要精神投注且在進行的當下很滿足愉快的事情。我個人的經驗是，去思考自己各種興趣發展出來的原因，可以幫助自己看到它們形成的共同因素。這感覺有點像是測驗學者去對一份測驗 (e.g., 語言能力測驗) 做因素分析，嘗試從這些實際可觀查到的測驗題目中，去歸納出在這些題目之下是在衡量哪些能力 (e.g., 詞彙理解、發音、文法)。我們的各種興趣就如同這些考題，它們之所以形成是因為背後的一些因素 (興趣：核心價值/考題：語言能力的各面向)，核心價值不容易直接被觀察到，但透過可見的興趣，我們可以去推敲、整理、歸納，嘗試找出背後孕育出這些興趣的核心價值。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>不過興趣這個切入點對某些人來說可能幫助不大，因為要知道自己的興趣為何其實並不容易。我想，興趣就像是任何有重量、有價值的事物一樣，並不是與生俱有的，而是需要投注心力與時間培養而來的。而恰巧在我們所生活的世界中，我們的心力與時間都相當有限，因為我們多數的時間精力都用在&lt;strong>完成他人要求或是期待我們完成的事情&lt;/strong>上，卻&lt;strong>沒有留下足夠的心力與時間投注在自己身上&lt;/strong>。我們連放鬆的時間都不夠，更別說要將額外的力氣用在自我探索上。然後這就開啟了惡性循環：越是不經思索地將精力用於滿足他人的需求與期待上，就越不會知道什麼對自己是真正重要的，越不知道什麼對自己是重要的，就會花越多精力去滿足他人的需求與期待。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>當然並不是說不可能從滿足他人需求的過程中發掘興趣，但一廂情願地期待能從被指派的工作中發現自己所好其實相當被動，因為這無異於在碰運氣 (這麼好康？別人要我做的事&lt;strong>碰巧&lt;/strong>跟我尚未發現的興趣有關)。除此之外，我們所隸屬的團體都有自己的目的以及脈絡，團體要成員做的事情因而常是出於自己的目的而非為了成員的個人成長。公司要我們做事是為了賺錢，社團年年籌辦活動是為了維持運作與維繫傳統，甚至就連我們為家庭的付出很常都是在滿足家庭價值與傳統觀念。如果我們將所有的心力都花費在這上面，那就等同於將探索自我的範圍壓縮在這些非常狹隘的領域之中。相較之下，給自己更多的時間與空間，讓自己能跟著思考或感覺自主決定探索的方向，似乎比較有可能發掘珍貴的東西。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>或許學習&lt;strong>同等地尊重他人與自己&lt;/strong>會是很重要的一步。我們尊重他人，因此在自己的能力及責任範圍內，我們盡力去完成該做的以及被交辦的事；但與此同時，我們對自己也應有同等的尊重，尊重自己也應得同等品質的時間與精力，讓我們有辦法投注足夠的心力在想做的事上。&lt;/p></description><category>thoughts</category><category>Psychology</category><category>中文</category></item><item><title>功利社會下的自我反思</title><link>https://yongfu.name/2020/06/27/flow/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yongfu.name/2020/06/27/flow/</guid><description>&lt;p>這是一篇關於&lt;em>心流 (Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience)&lt;/em> 的讀書心得。寫這篇文章的目的有兩個，一是記錄與分享書中自己特別有感觸的地方；另一個則是希望能將此書推薦給讀者。當然，跟書的作者比起來，我的文筆遠遠不如，所以如果你已決定要看這本書，就趕快開始看吧，不要浪費時間看這篇推薦文。但若你正猶豫要不要看這本書，或許可以利用這篇文章增強你的閱讀動機。我在看這本書的時候一直有「為什麼我不早點看這本書」的感受。身為一位主修心理學的學生，我一直知道心流理論的存在，也知道這本書，但就是一直沒有翻開這本書來看（這世界有太多書可以選擇了）。在看完這本書後，我只感到在心理系受的心理學訓練所帶給我人生上的啟發與幫助，遠遠不及這本書。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="心流是什麼">「心流」是什麼？&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>這應該是書中最理論的地方，但要理解「心流」這個概念，並不需要什麼心理學的專業訓練。正如作者所說，這本書是寫給大眾而非文謅謅的學術作品。只要細心體驗過生活，應該都能了解自己曾有過的那種「心流」經驗。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我們體驗過的&lt;strong>正向&lt;/strong>經驗大致可分成兩種：&lt;strong>享樂&lt;/strong>與&lt;strong>樂趣&lt;/strong>。&lt;strong>享樂&lt;/strong>是指生理需求或社會制約的期待獲得滿足的狀態，例如睡覺、放鬆、進食、性愛、飲酒、吸毒、娛樂等。透過享樂，我們可以暫時讓心神恢復平靜&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;經由進食，我們可以平復飢餓的不適；工作完回家後，我們常常追劇、看 YouTube 放鬆心情；極端一點的，則是使用酒精或藥物讓自己短暫脫離這紛擾的世界。另一種正向經驗，與享樂接近但本質不同的是&lt;strong>樂趣&lt;/strong>。樂趣會帶給人意想不到的正向感受，並時常伴隨著&lt;strong>成就感&lt;/strong>。與實力相當的人打球、下棋；讀一本書而獲得啟發、與作者產生共鳴；在書桌前努力解出一道困難的題目，或是思索難解的問題；甚至是烹飪、烤餅乾、種菜、插花、寫字 (書法)、作畫。這些都是能帶來樂趣的活動。而享樂與樂趣最大的不同是，前者是在被動滿足需求或欲望，後者則需要具備&lt;strong>足夠技能&lt;/strong>，並經由主動、&lt;strong>全心&lt;/strong>的投入才能獲得，因為只有全神貫注地投入，一個人才具備能面對當前挑戰的能力。這種透過努力而克服挑戰的過程，會讓人經驗到不可思議的正向感受，個體也會在這個過程中成長。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>這種全心全意地投注注意力在一件事情上的狀態即是&lt;strong>心流&lt;/strong>。在這個過程中，因為&lt;strong>注意力&lt;/strong>全部被用在面對當前的挑戰，當事人無暇去注意其他紛雜的事物、甚至會忘卻自我。此時的內心狀態是非常平靜的，任何焦慮、無聊的感受都會被排除在意識之外，腦中的事物只剩當下所面臨的挑戰。心流狀態會在當事者所具備之技能與所面臨之挑戰難度吻合時出現。如果不吻合，則會出現其他狀態&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;當挑戰難度大於所具備之技能，會令人感到&lt;strong>焦慮 (anxiety)&lt;/strong>；反之，若挑戰太簡單，則會感到&lt;strong>無聊 (bordom)&lt;/strong>。&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://img.yongfu.name/posts/flow.jpg" style="width:75%">
&lt;p>以上的內容大致就是心流的理論內容。但心流並不僅是一種心理狀態，它也是一種生活的態度，更是&lt;strong>幸福感&lt;/strong>的泉源。下方是幾個我在讀完書後，特別令我感觸深刻的主題。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="活在當下">活在當下&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>成長過程中，我們一直有一個信念&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;未來是人生最重要的一部份。父母教導孩子，如果現在就養成良好的習慣，對他們的將來會有幫助。老師們也跟孩子保證，現在上的這些課程雖然無趣，但是對將來是有益的，可以幫助他們找到好工作。公司老闆也告訴資淺的員工要有耐心、要努力工作，將來就能晉升，在辛苦漫長的努力後，緊接而來的就是黃金燦爛的退休歲月了。就如美國哲學家愛默生說的，「我們一直想著未來要過什麼樣的生活，但到頭來卻像沒有真正活過一樣」。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(p. 39)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>容易引發心流體驗的活動都是自發性參與的，不是為了外來的目標與動機。換言之，這些&lt;strong>活動的目的即是活動本身&lt;/strong> (autotelic)，而從事這些活動所帶來的籌賞，則來自參與者自身努力後所產生的心流體驗。我們不需要仰賴社會上的價值來說服自己和別人，這些能引發樂趣的活動是有意義的。然而事實是，我們時時刻刻都在尋找社會所認同的價值來「證實」自己的行為是有意義的。因此，我們做的每一件事情都必須「合理」、「有目的」，必須讓自己的「未來」更好。我們不斷追尋著未來，卻忽略了人生最重要的，不是客觀的外在環境、不是我們達成了多少目標，而是我們&lt;strong>主觀的經驗&lt;/strong>。我們主觀所經驗到的事物才是真的，它才是我們人生的一切，畢竟我們所意識到的一切皆是我們主觀詮釋的結果。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>活到現在這個歲數，我們耗費了多少精力在對未來感到焦慮？因為這種焦慮，我們又耗掉了多少娛樂時間在撫平這種焦慮？然後又因為千篇一律的娛樂感受到多少次的無聊？但除了未來的焦慮以及生活的無聊之外，我們卻鮮少靜下心來專注在一件事上，隔絕外來的所有刺激，進入那個只屬於自己的世界&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;沒有未來沒有過去，沒有無聊沒有焦慮，只有眼前那個需要全神貫注面對的挑戰。&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>當現有經驗就可以帶來無窮的回報，我們也就不需要把希望都放在不可預知的未來了。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(p. 112)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="原來我一直很功利">原來我一直很功利&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>徹底社會化的人只懂得追求周遭的人也認同的獎賞，而這些獎賞往往與天性的欲望不謀而合。他可能會遇見許多可以為人生帶來真正滿足的經歷，但都忽略了，因為這些與他渴望的東西不一樣。他在意的不是現在擁有的東西，而是照著別人的期待走可能得到的收穫。受制於社會制約下的他，只能不斷追求一到手就化為烏有的獎賞&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(p. 42)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>我們生活在一個講求功利 (學經歷、權力、地位、財富、名聲) 的社會，任何事都需要符合功利的思維邏輯才顯得合理。即使在以高等教育與研究為目標的大學亦是如此。曾經我自以為是個不受功利思想拘束的人，所以大膽地依照自己的興趣選了個就業光景不如何好的心理學系。然而實際上的情況是，我不停地依循著內化的社會價值，以功利的邏輯說服自己這個選擇以及未來前進之方向的合理性。一開始，我說服自己說，「心理學可以幫助人」，所以或許未來可以讀臨床心理學，成為臨床心理師 (這邊的功利是「名聲」，社會對於懸壺濟世有著非常高的評價，我也覺得這很好，但這並非「由內而外」的動機，是無法長久支持一個人的)。等到我發現自己對於臨床這個領域實在不怎麼感興趣，我開始有意無意地尋找從事研究工作的邏輯。我想，我可以加入一個實驗室，慢慢磨慢慢磨，最後成為一位獨立的研究者，從事自己「喜歡」的研究 (又是一個「未來」會更好的概念)。然而當時我有個深沉的疑惑&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;如果我真的選擇了一個實驗室熬下去，那我到底是真的對「研究」有興趣還是對研究人員所擁有的「名聲」與「地位」有所憧憬。這個疑惑在我大學快畢業時&lt;a href="https://yongfu.name/2020/01/30/undergrad">解開了第一層&lt;/a>，在我讀完心流後解開了第二層&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;求學與研究的&lt;strong>每個當下&lt;/strong>本身就該是籌賞與動力來源，如果無法在這個過程中時時體驗到「解開謎團的樂趣」，那研究之路就不比其它職業來得不「功利」：依然是為了更好的「未來」、為了做出更「重大」的發現、為了得到更高的學術「聲望」。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>長期生長在這個講求功利的社會，讓我們將這些社會價值內化，以致於功利的邏輯滲入我們一切的思考。我們近乎迷信地相信追求這些高社會評價的事物會為自己帶來幸福，卻忽略了真正的&lt;strong>幸福不假外求&lt;/strong>。真正的幸福源自於全神貫注在自己深感興趣的挑戰上。幸福感是由內而外產生的，是來自於努力過後的心靈，而非外來的獎賞 (這充其量只能滿足「享樂」的需求而已)。幸福感是來自於努力的過程，而不是長久努力後所帶來的美好結果與未來 (這是欺騙勞工好用的標語)。如果我們只為了追求「目標」的達成，卻從未仔細體驗「過程」本身，那我們注定要錯過幸福。&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>一個人如果過於自滿，就會覺得把精神能量花在新事物是浪費，除非這麼做可以得到外來的獎賞。就這樣，生活不再有樂趣，享樂成為正向經驗的唯一來源。&lt;/p>

&lt;p>現代人愈來愈容易將自己內心的感受解讀成自然的呼喚。直覺成了很多人唯一相信的權威。如果某見識給你的感覺是好的，那就一定是對的。當我們不假思索的順從基因與社會指示時，就等同放棄了對意識的控制，成了無可救藥、缺乏人性的玩物。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(p. 41)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>回顧截至目前的人生，有太多時候我都在用膚淺的外在價值傷害真實的內在動機，這幾乎已經變成一種反射動作。最常見的景象就是「為什麼要&lt;strong>學&lt;/strong>英文/拉丁文/數學/程式&amp;hellip;」。大概除了英文&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>之外，每一個我都有個符合功利邏輯的理由&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;拉丁文是因為有些英文詞彙源於拉丁文，所以學習拉丁文有助於英文學習 (高中)；學習數學是因為統計學、生態演化模型都會用到數學，所以要打好數學基礎 (大一至大三)；&lt;a href="https://yongfu.name/2018/01/31/RlearningPath">學習寫程式&lt;/a> (R 語言) 則是因為曾經在處理統計資料時吃過苦頭。但是到了現在，我保有並持續學習的技能卻只剩寫程式而已。原因並不是因為我常常要跑統計或是程式能力對就業很重要&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>，而是因為在學習寫程式的過程中，我發現這件事&lt;strong>本身&lt;/strong>就能帶給我無止盡的樂趣。其它為了追求社會制約的獎賞而學習的技能，多半淪為三分鐘熱度，沒有在我身上留下任何痕跡，卻佔據了我大半的青春。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>我想，或許就是這種為了服膺於社會功利邏輯的壓力，讓許多人無暇習得足以自娛的技能，因為所有的精力都耗在將自己塑造成符合社會期待的樣子，深信著這是對自己未來最好的道路。但我們鮮少在真正體驗到平靜、幸福的狀態後，仔細感受它的真實性以及之於自己的意義。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>這篇文章並非在責怪我們社會的功利，這種功利是當前社會文化發展下的必然結果，厭惡式的批評不會造成任何改變。但可以改變的是我們對自己以及對世界的認識。我們可以選擇不要以社會制約的價值來看待一切事物。我們也可以選擇不要任由容易被利用&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>的生理需求擺佈。然這一切需始於對自我意識的掌握，而掌握自我意識，則需始於心流的體驗。&lt;/p>

&lt;p>近幾年不論是新聞內容或是周遭朋友同學轉發的內容，都讓我越感擔心。對於同一件事情，我常常看到完全相反的詮釋，更令我感到不適的是，只要知道發文的機構或人是誰，&lt;strong>就能猜對內文的立場&lt;/strong>。我們或許永遠無法確定事情背後的真相，但有一件事是確定的：&lt;em>&lt;strong>沒有人永遠是正確的&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>。從這個原則就可以判定，驅動這些兩極化論述的，是人&lt;strong>自動化、直覺式、對於特定事物既有的信念&lt;/strong>，論述的內容不論多有邏輯或沒有邏輯，都是在這些直覺信念之後產生、用來說服他人和自己，自己所抱持的信念才是正確的。這點尤其值得我們這些接受當今高等教育的學生的警惕。現今的高等教育瀰漫的是一種崇尚自由、平等、關懷弱勢、社會正義的價值。與此同時，接受過高等教育的人通常在論述能力上相對優越，也因此許多支持這些自由與正義價值的論述在品質與邏輯嚴密性上都非常完善，而反方的論述常常在我們這些「知識份子」眼中顯得相當「無腦」。這裡正是「知識份子的傲慢」開始滲入的地方，我們常常仰賴我們優秀的論述能力，堵住與我們意見相左之人的嘴，一方面期待對方能在我們縝密的論述下被感召，另一方面也更加鞏固自己所抱持的特定信念。但我們通常沒意識到的是，剝開這些冠冕堂皇的論述之後，所剩下最核心的信念與價值觀念，其實並沒有優劣對錯之分，它反映的不過是每個人成長過程中逐步形塑出的人格、價值與道德觀。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>成長的過程中，時常聽到教育者或長輩諸如「邏輯思考很重要」、「辨認他人論述中的謬誤很重要」的論述，讀了心理系更讓我增添了&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias">為他人所犯的論述謬誤命名&lt;/a>的能力。但我覺得我們的教育裡缺乏了一項更重要的東西&amp;mdash;同理與自己不一樣的人，尤其是與自己立場天差地別的人。大學最後兩年的體驗，讓我發現這件事非常困難，因為它需要的不只是邏輯思考，更需要能以「牴觸個人核心價值」的觀點進行思考。我認為婚姻平權議題 (對我們這一代) 很適合當作一個開始，練習同理與自己立場相反的人，因為我們對這議題正反兩方背後的價值信念本來就有一些了解 (只是不見得慎重面對與思考過)。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="婚姻家愛情">婚姻、家、愛情&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>在婚姻平權的議題上，我與周遭大多數的朋友同學一樣，立場是支持婚姻關係不應僅限於男女之間。婚姻平權的概念在我們這代中，似乎直覺到我們無法理解任何合理的反對理由。但究竟為什麼我們的許多長輩，包含我自己的父母親，反對婚姻平權的立場如此強烈？我一直不能 (或是拒絕？) 理解他們的想法，直到看過了《好人總是自以為是》、接受了一學期難以參透的文化人類學的薰陶之後，才開始稍稍理解為何婚姻平權的概念對許多長輩帶來如此強烈的衝擊。原因是這個概念強烈地攻擊了華人傳統文化下的家庭及婚姻的觀念。如果我們翻開民法親屬編 (越早期的越明顯)，會發現裡面不時透露出這種傳統的家庭概念；從儒家經典中也可體會到這種家庭的觀念：例如「仁者，人也，親親為大」、「孝弟也者，其為仁之本與」、「不孝有三無後為大」、「君子之道，造端乎夫婦；及其至也，察乎天地」，從這些名言中可以發現儒家的核心觀念「仁」與「孝」乃至「君子」都密切地與儒家文化下的「家」的概念緊密結合在一起，而「家」的組成，在儒家與華人文化下 (還有很多其它文化) 是以「夫婦」為基礎。這套龐大的價值觀念是許多人待人處事的依據與道德準則，修改民法 (某種程度上是許多人心中道德價值的體現) 的婚姻規定就如同在攻擊這套核心的道德價值。這對許多人來說是無法接受的，他們的感受或許類似郭靖聽到小龍女和楊過既為師徒又是伴侶時，所出現驚恐與憤怒。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>婚姻平權的論戰，底層所反映的其實是關於婚姻核心價值觀念的差異。我們這一代受到西方觀念的影響較大，「平等、正義」是我們這輩的許多人最核心的道德價值。但對於我們的長輩，「家庭」則非常核心&amp;mdash;父慈子孝、相夫教子、修身齊家治國平天下 &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; ，理想的「家」有個既定的模樣，是很多人非常重視甚至追求的重要目標。對於這兩種價值觀念，我認為兩者的本質皆相當的良善與感人，更別說有誰對誰錯、誰優誰劣的問題。事實上，在有了這層的思考之後，我開始認為在當今的臺灣社會選擇修改民法婚姻章確有不合理之處。民法親屬編是目前多數人道德價值的體現，修改民法親屬編就如同否決了多數人的道德價值，強迫人們「改良」他們的道德觀念，朝西歐與北美的主流思維邁進。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>下方以一個更極端的例子來說明修改婚姻以及家庭的定義可能對一個人的價值觀所產生的衝擊。&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="愛情作為家庭的基礎">愛情作為家庭的基礎&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>不論是在對同性婚姻接受度較高的歐美或是深受儒家思想薰陶的華人文化中，組成家庭的前提皆是&lt;strong>婚姻&lt;/strong>，而婚姻的前提是&lt;strong>愛情&lt;/strong>。換言之，「兩人間的情愛關係」與「家」的概念彼此是緊密結合的。這種對「家」的概念，&lt;strong>排除&lt;/strong>了社會上特定的人組織家庭的可能，例如，有些人無法對其他人產生愛情的感受、有些人就是運氣不好找不到對的人、有些人 (因為太過特殊) 找不到願意以婚姻關係共同生活的人。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>由於我們 (無論支持或反對婚姻平權) 對於家庭的想像是建立在愛情的基礎上，關於&lt;strong>多元成家&lt;/strong> (家庭的組成不僅限於婚姻與血緣關係) 的討論引起的關注就相當稀少。我們這一輩的許多人對於婚姻平權的想像，背後的核心價值除了「平等」之外，也隱含著家庭是以「愛情關係」為基礎。就這點上，無論同性婚姻或是僅限一男一女的婚姻，其對於家庭的價值是相當類似的。因此，如果我們認為&lt;strong>只有自己抱持的那種價值才是正確&lt;/strong>的，「不認同家庭應&lt;strong>只能&lt;/strong>以愛情為基礎」 的人，也能進一步對於&lt;a href="https://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawParaDeatil.aspx?pcode=B0000001&amp;amp;bp=105">民法親屬篇婚姻章&lt;/a>以及&lt;a href="https://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=B0000008">司法院釋字第七四八號解釋施行法&lt;/a>提出批評，因為這些法律皆將家庭的組成&lt;strong>限縮&lt;/strong>在愛情關係之下。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="同理自己討厭的人">同理自己討厭的人&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>這邊我想強調的是，不論是華人傳統家庭價值、婚姻平權的概念抑或多元成家的想法，它們背後各自的核心道德價值，並無好壞優劣。但同時，因為這些價值與個人的道德判斷有非常強列的連結，我們太容易因為這些信仰就對意見相左的人產生厭惡，拒絕去了解對方，甚至開始憎恨對方。能意識到許多爭執源自這些核心價值上的差異，並能接受自己不一定正確而對方也不一定錯誤，甚至能以對方的觀點看待事情並認同對方的想法&amp;mdash;這是我對一個成熟、有智慧之人的理想想像。有智慧的人不一定能邏輯縝密地滔滔雄辯，但卻具有足夠的認知複雜度，能理解、接受與認同多種價值同時並存的可能。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>這是一件超級困難的事，因為要抑制道德直覺所產生的反感並同時以他人的觀點思考，需要消耗非常多的認知資源。大家寧可泡在同溫層裡互相取暖，既輕鬆又可反覆確認自己的正確性。生存在一個充滿正反對立的世界，這或許是我們最該培養的能力&amp;mdash;在口嘴爆發前，我們付出多少努力同理自己討厭的人？&lt;/p></description><category>book</category><category>thoughts</category><category>中文</category></item><item><title>大四老屁股的一些小技巧</title><link>https://yongfu.name/2019/01/04/trivial-skills/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yongfu.name/2019/01/04/trivial-skills/</guid><description>&lt;p>在似乎完成了很多但又似乎沒達成什麼的感覺中，大學生活逐漸步入尾聲。回顧這幾年學到的東西，沒幾個可以拿出來說嘴，更別說是對每個人都有用的能力或技巧。不過有些小技巧似乎過於「微不足道」，反而沒人意識到這些技巧也是花時間摸索出來的。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>沒有指引之下的學習需要經過不少試誤、耗費許多時間精力。這篇文章將記錄這三年多來學會的一些「微不足道」的小技巧。再不寫下來，我或許會把這些事情視為理所當然，忘記這背後是多少經驗的累積。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="影印書籍">影印書籍&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>大一時就開始去影印店印一些課本&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>，當時什麼都不知道，只是將 PDF 檔交給影印店。隨著印過越來越多書才逐漸抓住印書時該注意的一些小地方：&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>減輕重量：&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>書要印成 B5，A4 太大過重&lt;/li>
&lt;li>書的頁數不要超過 500 頁，若超過可分成兩個 PDF 檔印&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>頁數增減：&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Preface, Acknowledgment 可以刪掉，但 References 和 Index 不建議刪掉&lt;/li>
&lt;li>如果 References 和 Index 很多頁，可以將&lt;a href="https://online2pdf.com/multiple-pages-per-sheet">兩面合併為一面&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>如果一本書分成兩部份印，最好兩本都保留 Contents, References 和 Index。亦即，盡量讓每部份的書 self-contained&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>美觀：&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>注意奇偶數頁碼：&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>如果你曾看過&lt;a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/blogdown.pdf">書的 PDF 檔&lt;/a>，或許曾注意到&lt;strong>有些頁面會刻意留白&lt;/strong>。這些空白頁是為了確保&lt;strong>奇數頁碼的頁面永遠在(翻開的)書的右邊，偶數頁碼的頁面永遠在書的左邊&lt;/strong>。此外，新章節(Contents, Chapter x, References 和 Index 等都算章節)通常以奇數頁開頭&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>。&lt;br>
若頁碼是在頁面的正中間下方(而非角落)，那通常就沒有上述的特徵。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>在增減書的頁面時(特別是刪除 Preface 和 Acknowledgment 頁面)，有時需在新章節開始前插入或刪除空白頁面，以維持&lt;strong>奇數頁碼的頁面永遠在(翻開的)書的右邊，偶數頁碼的頁面永遠在書的左邊&lt;/strong>。&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>裁切 PDF：&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>PDF 的頁邊空白過大或有不重要的字串時，可以使用 &lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/briss/">briss&lt;/a> 之類的軟體一次裁切所有的頁面。&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>如果喜歡，可以&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jB0ceBE0cFDyaNDQ5t-DmGujxHlHj1WGJYRXRnZgPNg/edit?usp=sharing">自製封面&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>請老闆&lt;strong>印書背&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>如果是台大學生或住公館附近，推薦&lt;a href="https://goo.gl/maps/UtUB8QnYgMv">遠雄影印&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="寫卡片">寫卡片&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>儒家文化下的讀書人要精通琴棋書畫，但我從未看過我們這代精通四藝&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>的人，我自己更是一項都不行。四藝當中，我認為最重要的是「書」。儘管平時並不如何在意自己字醜，但要寫卡片時(尤其是&lt;em>重要的卡片&lt;/em>)，才發現字醜真的很要命。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>對於許多字寫不漂亮的人(至少我是這樣)，很大一部分原因是無法掌握每個字所需佔據的空間。我在寫卡片時，需先在卡片上用鉛筆打草稿，而這也是最頭痛的地方。首先，需小心翼翼的輕描免得留下印痕；寫完之後需將鉛筆筆跡擦掉，因此常連帶將未乾的原子筆墨水拓開而毀掉卡片。為了解決這些問題，我決定不在卡片上打草稿，而是用一張跟卡片一樣大的白紙當草稿寫過一次，然後在卡片上&lt;strong>用鉛筆輕點定位出每個字的位置&lt;/strong>。&lt;em>這真的浪費很多時間&lt;/em>，因為&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>需要先測量卡片的大小，剪出符合此大小的白紙，並在這張白紙上：&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>決定字的大小，然後計算、點出一行中每個字的位置&lt;/li>
&lt;li>決定行距，然後標出每行的位置&lt;/li>
&lt;li>寫完草稿&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>在卡片上點出每個字的位置後，再將字寫上去&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>當我第一次這樣寫完卡片後，我忽然意識到&lt;strong>第 1 點一定有工具能代替手工&lt;/strong>。於是，我找到了一個完全符合需求的線上&lt;a href="https://incompetech.com/graphpaper/squaredots/">方格紙產生器&lt;/a>：&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="https://img.yongfu.name/assets/images/grid_paper.png" style="width:70%">
&lt;p>這個&lt;strong>方格紙產生器&lt;/strong>可以自訂字的間距 (Grid Spacing) 以及紙張和頁邊的大小。因此有了這個工具後，就可以在量測完卡片的大小後，輸入數值做出草稿用紙。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="上台報告投影片">上台報告(投影片)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>上台報告對我來說是個很大的挑戰，因為我會緊張到忘記本來要講演的邏輯。克服這挑戰的關鍵當然是練習 &amp;ndash; &lt;em>寫下報告的講稿反覆練習，直到能自然(自動化)地完成報告&lt;/em>。但除了練習之外，我過去一直忽略&lt;strong>工具&lt;/strong>的重要性。事實上，有了正確的工具後，根本&lt;strong>不需擔心會忘記要講什麼&lt;/strong>。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>幾乎所有投影片工具 (PowerPoint, Google Slides, &lt;a href="https://revealjs.com">reveal.js&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://remarkjs.com">Remark.js&lt;/a>) 都有&lt;strong>簡報者模式 (presenter mode)&lt;/strong>：&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://img.yongfu.name/assets/images/google_slide.gif" alt="Google Slides Presenter Mode" width='85%'/>

&lt;figcaption>Remark.js 簡報者模式。左邊是簡報者看到的內容，右邊是觀眾看到的同步內容。&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>但我知道有人因為不知道&lt;strong>簡報者模式需配合&lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/zh-tw/help/4340331/windows-10-set-up-dual-monitors">延伸螢幕&lt;/a>使用&lt;/strong>而未曾使用這個功能(對，就是我！)。透過延伸螢幕，可以在自己的電腦與投影幕上同步顯示投影片，只是其中一個是有筆記的簡報者模式，另一個則是給觀眾看的一般模式。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="電子辭典">電子辭典&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>在電腦上看英文內容遇到不懂的單字時，往往要開啟瀏覽器去查單字。若有很多單字不懂，就要反覆切換視窗畫面。Mac 內建有辭典工具，透過反白文字就可在小視窗中查詢該單字，並可以&lt;a href="https://diary.taskinghouse.com/posts/2186795-install-traditional-chinese-english-dictionary-to-mac-built-in-dictionary/">安裝第三方字典檔&lt;/a>擴充其詞彙。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Windows 和 Linux 使用者沒有這麼方便的內建辭典功能，但透過 &lt;a href="http://goldendict.org/">GoldenDict&lt;/a> 可以達到一樣的效果。&lt;strong>GoldenDict&lt;/strong> 是一個開源的字典軟體，本身不含字典檔，但支援多種字典檔案格式，因此可以安裝多個字典檔擴充其詞彙。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>使用方式：&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>將字反白後再按快捷鍵 (可自訂)，就會跳出小視窗顯示該字的查詢結果&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;figure>

&lt;h2 id="記錄想法">記錄想法&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>沒有記憶就彷彿不曾存在&lt;/em> 。生活在資訊量爆炸的時代，「記住重要的事情，忽略不重要的刺激」似乎變成一項重要的能力。如果我們不努力記下重要的事情，那這些記憶就會被其它瑣碎的、不重要的刺激&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>洗掉。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>面對海量的資訊，網路上有許多專案管理軟體可以幫忙記下事情。我自己習慣使用 &lt;a href="https://trello.com">Trello&lt;/a>，因為覺得它使用起來相當順手(筆記可用 Markdown 語法、Board, List, Card 的階層分類方式)。例如，我用一個 Board 記下未來可能會用到的&lt;a href="https://trello.com/b/UerBS2oH/online-resources">線上資源&lt;/a>。除此之外，目前還有其它十幾個 Board，各自管理一個主題。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>用什麼專案管理軟體當然不是重點，最重要的是，在遇見重要想法時能立刻記錄下來。生活在這奇怪的時代 (資訊科技可以幫助人們過得更好，但也可以把人們害得很慘)，學習善用資訊科技的產物變得非常重要。&lt;/p>

&lt;p>學 R 語言很有趣&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>，但也相當耗時耗力。我在學習 R 上花了大量的時間，若不是運氣好找到對的方向，我不可能花費那麼多力氣去學 R，甚至可能直接放棄。雖然如此，我還是感到有點可惜，若能更早知道有效率的學習方式，就不必花費如此大量的時間 (及紙張) 在學習上。因此，我希望將學習 R 的心路歷程寫下，給想學 R 的人做為參考，或許可以減短學習初期耗費精神的時期。接下來，我將說明：&lt;/p>

&lt;p>R 學習路徑：若從頭來過，我會如何學習 R、挑選哪些資源，讓自己更有效率地學習。&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>為何我能持續學習 R 而未放棄？其實現在我比較頭大的問題是：&lt;strong>要怎麼克制自己不要一直打開 Rstudio？&lt;strong>正是因為我學 R 的過程如同打電動一樣歡樂，所以&lt;/strong>放棄&lt;/strong>這個問題根本不存在。但事實上，剛開始學 R 時並不如何歡樂，直到上了課才越來越喜歡 R。&lt;/p>

&lt;p>起初是抱著學好 R 語言 (加上通識快修不完) 的心情去加簽這門課的，但課堂上 R 語言的語法卻教得不多。然正是這種&lt;strong>不聚焦在程式語法的課程安排&lt;/strong>，讓我把 R 學得非常好。如果課程從頭到尾都在教 R 語言，到期末我一定會受不了越顯複雜的語法，最後便隨意敷衍了事。我在這門課收穫最大的，反而不是課堂學到的技巧，而是老師、助教們傳達的一些概念與想法，以及自己探索這些概念想法的樂趣與收穫：&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Open Source&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> 以及 R 的生態圈&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>資料科學與 Story telling: &lt;strong>Coding&lt;/strong> 於資料科學中的應用，不僅是傳統所強調的&lt;strong>功能性&lt;/strong>，Coding 亦於&lt;strong>美觀及呈現&lt;/strong>上扮演重要的角色。資料科學透過 Coding 處理、分析資料；同時也透過 Coding 作圖將資料視覺化，好將資料科學上的發現&lt;strong>說成故事給其他人聽&lt;/strong>。&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>文本分析: 我本來對這部分最沒有興趣，直到我意識到文本資料是研究人類行為、社會與文化最重要的資料來源之一&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> &lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>。&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Reproducibility: &lt;a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown&lt;/a> (&lt;code>.Rmd&lt;/code>) 是我見過最強大的文件格式，可以輸出成網頁、投影片、PDF、Word、Markdown 等。這讓使用者可以在一份文件中做事情 (&lt;code>Rmd&lt;/code>)，並依據所需輸出成各種文件，而不用剪剪貼貼 (從 Word 貼到 PPT)，也省下排版所花費的心力。例如，要報告可輸出成投影片 (&lt;code>.html&lt;/code> 或 &lt;code>.pptx&lt;/code>) 、要列印可輸出成 PDF、要放到網路上可輸出成網頁。R Markdown 讓使用者能以簡單有效率的方式工作，這是達到 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility">Reproducibility&lt;/a> 的前提與重要基礎。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="課程起手式">課程起手式&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>這門課與我個性相符，完全顯現在第一堂課實習課 (Lab Session) 的作業上。作業與 R 並無相關，而是要使用 Markdown 格式撰寫自我介紹。由於我對簡約風有點痴迷&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> (受 Markdown 影響後更為痴迷)，在 Markdown 上花了一些時間研究。目前，透過 R 與 Pandoc Markdown 語法的整合 (即 R Markdown)，我可以快速簡潔地寫出含有上下標、Footnotes、超連結、citation 的精美文件&lt;sup id="fnref:8">&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>或文章 (例如，這篇部落格) 而完全不須使用 html 語法。這讓我在寫許多作業時，效率提高不少。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>對 R Markdown 的痴迷與熱愛可說是我R語言功力進步的關鍵。&lt;strong>R Markdown 賦予每個人將想法傳達給其他人的能力&lt;/strong>&lt;sup id="fnref:9">&lt;a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>，因此，&lt;strong>能做出美好的東西並與其他人分享&lt;/strong>成為我學習 R 最強烈的動機之一。例如，當初在做這門課的&lt;a href="https://rlads2017g1.github.io/presentation.html">期末專案&lt;/a> 時，發覺 R 可以畫出很多種&lt;a href="http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/">互動式圖表&lt;/a> (不須懂 JavaScript)，於是我開始尋找最適合呈現資料的方式。由於不同種類的圖，常有不同資料格式的要求&lt;sup id="fnref:10">&lt;a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>，因此為了畫出最適合的圖，我反覆整理許多資料以符合格式。這使得我在 data wrangling 上，能力大幅提升。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="r-學習路徑">R 學習路徑&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="起步">起步&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>我剛開始學 R 時不算順遂&lt;sup id="fnref:11">&lt;a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>。剛進到 R 的世界，一定會被為數眾多的 function&lt;sup id="fnref:12">&lt;a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> (以及更多的學習資源) 搞得迷失方向，不知從何開始。事實上，這不是我們的錯，因為連 R 的社群內也有相關的爭論：&lt;strong>Base R first vs. Tidyverse first&lt;/strong> (詳細可參考&lt;a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/">此文&lt;/a>)。R 真的是一個使用門檻不低的軟體，要精通它不是一、兩年內的事情&lt;sup id="fnref:13">&lt;a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>，所以一定要對 R 有熱情，才可能持續支撐對於 R 的學習&lt;sup id="fnref:14">&lt;a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>R 語言的基礎 ─ &lt;strong>Base R&lt;/strong> 是剛開始學 R 的一大障礙，這也是為何會有 &lt;strong>Base R first vs. Tidyverse first debate&lt;/strong>。由於學好 R (更精確地說，是學好 &lt;strong>Base R&lt;/strong>) 需一段時間，我認為 &lt;strong>Base R first&lt;/strong> 的學習方式很容易使初學者放棄。但學習 R 不可能不接觸 &lt;strong>Base R&lt;/strong> ，因為它是 R 語言最重要的基礎。因此，我覺得最好的方式是&lt;strong>交錯並進&lt;/strong>：&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Base R&lt;/strong> 學到一定的基礎後 (不必精通) &lt;sup id="fnref:15">&lt;a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>，開始學習用&lt;code>tidyverse&lt;/code>套件處理資料。之後隨著時間，自然而然就會熟悉這兩者。&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="維持">維持&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>學習一項新技能最困難的地方大概是要能&lt;strong>持續穩定前進&lt;/strong>。我認為有幾種方法可以幫助自己：&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>參考書&lt;/strong>：一本好的參考書，能作為一個參照指標，&lt;strong>幫助自己安排進度&lt;/strong>，也&lt;strong>讓自己知道學到了哪裡&lt;/strong>。參考書指出了一條方向，比較不會在學習的路途中迷失 (相比零散的網路資源)。&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>修課&lt;/strong>：我非常建議在學校修一門 R 語言的課 (最好 3 學分以上)，但&lt;strong>不建議線上課程&lt;/strong>&lt;sup id="fnref:16">&lt;a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>。修課的話，有老師和助教提供經驗，能省下許多摸索的時間；每週有固定進度，或多或少可迫使自己持續接觸程式；若有期末專案，這會是 R 功力突飛猛進的最佳機會 (效果比起純粹練習好太多)。&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>讓自己喜歡 R&lt;/strong>：初學 R 時因為不知道這項的重要性，所以學得有點辛苦。這點真的很微妙，有時候太過專注於學習某項&amp;quot;技能&amp;quot;，反而會&lt;strong>過於專注實用性而忽略了趣味性&lt;/strong>，於是只剩理性說服自己：&lt;em>學這很有用，你一定要堅持下去&lt;/em>。通常開始這樣想，代表離放棄不遠了。這也是為何我很推 &lt;a href="https://nol2.aca.ntu.edu.tw/nol/coursesearch/print_table.php?course_id=142%20U0750&amp;amp;class=&amp;amp;dpt_code=1420&amp;amp;ser_no=76601&amp;amp;semester=106-1&amp;amp;lang=CH">R 語言與資料科學導論&lt;/a> 這門課的原因 ─ 老師真的很有智慧，不斷鼓勵學生們去想&lt;strong>有趣又可用資料科學回答的問題&lt;/strong>，也常介紹一些 R 意想不到的有趣應用，但從未將焦點放在程式的硬實力上。我自己由 R 善於&lt;strong>視覺呈現&lt;/strong>的特質切入 &amp;ndash; 從 R Markdown 開始，擴展到資料視覺化，又到網頁設計 (縱使我&lt;code>html&lt;/code>和&lt;code>css&lt;/code>基礎很差)，每一項對我來說都非常有趣，R 學起來因而樂此不疲。&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="實作專案">實作：專案&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>看再多參考書、修再多課、做再多練習題都比不上實際去完成一個專案。在實作專案的過程中，會&lt;strong>遇到一缸子自己不知如何解決的問題&lt;/strong>，因此過程中就是在不斷吸收新知識、學習如何問問題&lt;sup id="fnref:17">&lt;a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>，如此的學習效果是零散練習題的好幾倍。此外，做專案是自頭至尾走過一次資料科學的流程，從爬資料、整理、分析到呈現，將先前習得的零碎技巧組織在一起，會讓 R 的功力大增；同時，資料科學專案是在實際解決 (回答) 一個問題，這不僅對於自己，且對於社會有實質的意義與價值。&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="對於專案的一些建議">對於專案的一些建議&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>我認為要從實作專案收穫那麼多，不可或缺的因素同樣是&lt;strong>興趣與熱情&lt;/strong>。沒有這些一定不可能堅持完美，不能堅持完美，專案就會淪落為練習題 (反正只要跑出東西就好)。題目的選擇因而會是成敗的關鍵；與組員 (若為團體專案) 的溝通與共識更是關鍵中的關鍵，一定要在專案中找到最適合自己的角色，否則專案只是浪費時間。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="學習資源">學習資源&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>起初為了學 R 所印的兩本書以及聽的線上課程效果頗糟，讓我覺得自己起步不算順遂。這是因為當時對 R 不太了解，也不知如何觸及其社群，因而並未慎選書籍及課程即步入學習歷程。&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="學習歷程">學習歷程&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>若回到五個多月前，我會如此安排 R 的學習歷程：&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>基礎參考書 (若有餘力的話 + &lt;code>swirl&lt;/code>&lt;sup id="fnref:18">&lt;a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> 當練習題)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr">Hands-On Programming with R&lt;/a>：這是一本寫得非常好且相當簡單的書，目標讀者是沒有程式經驗的初學者 (雖然我覺得縱使有程式經驗也可看這本書了解 R 的邏輯)。此書內容僅聚焦在非常基礎的 &lt;strong>Base R&lt;/strong>，但重點是其將 R 的邏輯寫得非常清楚。我是在學 R 一陣子之後才看了這本書，對我有莫大的幫助。這本書相當短，可以很快看完，更多資訊請 &lt;a href="https://www.google.com.tw/search?biw=1280&amp;amp;bih=560&amp;amp;ei=rF90WtefO8W48QXcv4y4Dg&amp;amp;q=Hands-On+Programming+with+R&amp;amp;oq=Hands-On+Programming+with+R&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...1714146.1714146.0.1714717.1.1.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.0.0....0.FFjeBpwN_VQ">google 書名&lt;/a>。&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz">R for Data Science&lt;/a>：這本書應該只會越來越紅。如同其名，這本書就在教 R 於資料科學上的應用。與上本書不同的是，這本書以&lt;code>tidyverse&lt;/code>套件為基礎而非 Base R。雖然如此，此書並不需要 Base R 的基礎 (有的話會更好，所以我才推薦 &lt;strong>Hands-On&lt;/strong>)，需要的基礎書中都有介紹。&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>我建議可以先從 &lt;strong>Hands-On Programming with R&lt;/strong> 開始，因為這本書很短可以快速看完。之後再按照章節慢慢看 &lt;strong>R for Data Science&lt;/strong> (可配合學校上課進度，這本書短時間內看不完)，逐步累積自己的功力。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>上述兩本書都是英文的，或許有些人很抗拒英文，但中文書並非一個好選擇。當 R 學到某個程度後，更進階的資源幾乎全為英文；此外，google 問題解決方法時，用中文十之八九會找不到答案。看英文書可讓自己熟悉 R 的英文用語，而且這些書的英文都很簡單。&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>若有志探索 R 的其它可能性，可以參考 &lt;a href="https://bookdown.org">bookdown.org&lt;/a> 的書 (僅推薦 Star 100 以上，上面還是有一些雷書)。這裡的書都是用&lt;code>bookdown&lt;/code>套件寫的，而且皆為 open source，可以在網頁上看或下載到電腦 (詳見&lt;code>bookdown&lt;/code>套件)。&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>學校課程：如&lt;a href="#%E8%AA%B2%E7%A8%8B%E5%9B%9E%E9%A1%A7">課程回顧&lt;/a>所提及，一門 R 的課可以讓自己視野更加廣博。僅是自修閉門造車進步很慢、常常會落掉進度、而且頗為苦悶。有人帶領比較不會走偏方向，同時還能學到許多有趣的東西。&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>將 R 當玩具：如果學 R 如同遊戲一般好玩，那就沒有堅不堅持的問題了，這也是我自認學 R 相當成功的地方。以下，我將介紹一些我知道的有趣資源，不見得直接與資料分析相關，但一定可與 R 結合。&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/">R Graph Gallery&lt;/a> 、&lt;a href="http://www.htmlwidgets.org/">htmlwidgets for R&lt;/a> : R 最為吸引人的特徵之一就是其強大的繪圖功能，加上其它套件的擴充，幾乎所有跟資料有關的圖都可以用 R 畫。沒事多多欣賞其他人用 R 畫出的圖，不僅療癒放鬆，同時對 R 的能力有個大概的想像、未來更有可能會有使用需求。&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html">R Markdown&lt;/a> : 先前提過 R Markdown 很強大，可以點進 gallery 感受一下其生產力。我認為不會用 R Markdown 比起不會用 R 還要可惜。&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">Blogdown&lt;/a> : 我目前的網站 (一部份) 是透過 &lt;code>blogdown&lt;/code> 套件在經營&lt;sup id="fnref:19">&lt;a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>的。Blogdown 大幅降低了架站的門檻，即使完全不懂 HTML/CSS 也能快速上手，同時配合 Git/GitHub 能讓發表 (及修改) 文章的過程非常有效率。此外，以 &lt;code>blogdown&lt;/code> 架設的網頁是靜態的，不同於 Wordpress 等的動態網頁，靜態網頁的速度要快許多、不需要付費伺服器，而且容易搬遷。&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>集大成：專案製作&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>如&lt;a href="#%E5%AF%A6%E4%BD%9C%EF%BC%9A%E5%B0%88%E6%A1%88">實作：專案&lt;/a>所述，專案是讓自己快速進步的最佳方案。同時，結合上述的學習資源：&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>資料分析：&lt;strong>R for Data Science&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>視覺化：&lt;strong>R Graph Gallery&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>htmlwidgets&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>網頁製作：&lt;strong>R Markdown&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>Blogdown&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>這些都可以透過 R 完成，並且讓自己更有動機實作專案、讓專案看起來更完美。&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="更上一層樓following-and-followers">更上一層樓：Following and Followers&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Following&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Followers&lt;/strong> 是我直接借用 GitHub 上的用詞：&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Following: 該用戶追蹤的其他用戶&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Followers: 追蹤該用戶的其他用戶&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>透過追蹤 R 社群是一個讓自己跟上快速成長的 R 的好方法，讓自己每日都長一些知識。例如，我透過臉書追蹤 &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/rbloggers/">R bloggers&lt;/a>，裡面常出現優質好文，且內容通常清楚易讀。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>另一個讓 R 功力快速成長的方式，就是自己成為 R bloggers：我不是指寫的文章要登上 &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/rbloggers/">R bloggers&lt;/a>，而是像那些作者一樣在部落格上寫文章。寫文章是一種很好的學習方式，能幫自己重新組織所學，同時也可檢視是否真正了解正在撰寫的主題。文章不見得是寫給別人看的，有時忘記一些東西，透過自己的文字重新學習相當方便。推薦兩篇簡短的優質文說明寫 blog 的好處：&lt;a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/personal-experience.html">Yihui Xie&lt;/a> 、&lt;a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/advice-to-aspiring-data-scientists-start-a-blog/">David Robertson&lt;/a>。&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="小結">小結&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>我真的很慶幸能在大三時接觸到 R。以往我都把時間花在讀書上，也不知何時才能用得上。R 讓我發現了自己的嗜好&lt;sup id="fnref:20">&lt;a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>，也讓我體驗到&lt;strong>為了處理想解決的問題而學習&lt;/strong>的感覺。我也才慢慢體會到為了&lt;strong>興趣&lt;/strong>所學與為了&lt;strong>其它目的&lt;/strong> (競爭力、考試、學分、跟風？) 所學，能帶來的可觀差異。當然，興趣與其它目的並非不能同時存在，只是有時&lt;strong>專注在其它目的會抑制興趣&lt;/strong>，而最能讓學習持續的動力來源卻是興趣。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>這篇文章的目的，旨在提供有志學 R 卻不確定如何開始的人作參考。文章介紹的學習資源 (或是任何嘮叨的內容)，不只是 (我認為) 有用的，且能強烈引起我的興趣。希望讀過這篇文章的人，不僅僅獲益於文章介紹的學習資源，且能為了興趣而學 R ─ 這是此篇文章最想傳達的想法。&lt;/p>

&lt;p>我在開學前的暑假即開始自學 &lt;strong>R&lt;/strong>，進步相當緩慢，而且語法時常忘記。最重要的是，我必須花心力督促自己才能繼續。開學後在課堂上教導的內容不多，僅做些簡單的介紹，剩下的要靠自己發掘。由於深深感受到 Markdown 的潛力 (見&lt;strong>課程起手式&lt;/strong>，我開始「不務正業」，去學一些和 R (看似) 不怎麼相關的東西 (例如，研究如何用 GitHub Pages 架部落格)，也越來越喜歡 html 格式 (以前偏愛 PDF，但發現 html 能呈現的東西比 PDF 多太多，又比較美觀)。於是，R 成為我處理作業最常使用的程式之一。&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:11" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:12">
&lt;p>R 除了函數非常多，使用起來也非常彈性，對使用者的限制相當少：其它語言很容易跑出 error message，但在 R 卻相對不容易 (例如，輸入&lt;code>c (1, 2, &amp;quot;c&amp;quot;) &lt;/code>不會跑出 error 但會將&lt;code>1&lt;/code>, &lt;code>2&lt;/code>從&lt;strong>數字&lt;/strong>轉換成&lt;strong>字串&lt;/strong>)。這對初學者不見得是好事：初學者常因此難以釐清 R 運作的邏輯。&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:12" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:13">
&lt;p>精通 R 應該可算是一輩子的事吧，因為 R 是個不斷在成長的語言。R 的社群與生態圈成長非常迅速 (例如，目前 &lt;a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN&lt;/a> 有 12,081 個 package)，要精通 R 勢必要與它一起成長。即使只求在傳統的資料分析上熟悉 R，也需要花不少的時間，而且很難在短時間內大幅進步。&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:13" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:14">
&lt;p>這裡把 R 說得有點負面。當 R 融入你生活中，你喜歡它都來不及了 (不論是它讓你做事更有效率或它能做出很厲害的東西)，根本就沒有&lt;strong>支撐學習&lt;/strong>的問題，只有&lt;strong>時間不足&lt;/strong>的問題。&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:14" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:15">
&lt;p>&lt;strong>一定的基礎&lt;/strong>：了解 R 的&lt;strong>向量式運算邏輯&lt;/strong>、&lt;strong>資料結構&lt;/strong> (vector, list, matrix, dataframe) 、熟悉 &lt;strong>Subsetting&lt;/strong> (&lt;code>object[index]&lt;/code>)。見&lt;strong>學習資源&lt;/strong>了解更多。&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:15" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:16">
&lt;p>我覺得學習任何東西，如果有實體 (面對面) 的課程，都比線上課程還好。我自己很難集中注意力在線上課程，加上時間太自由容易怠惰，或有事情時就會將其順位往後挪，因此成效往往不彰。&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:16" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:17">
&lt;p>在網路上要輸對關鍵字才找得到答案。起初由於不清楚 R 的運作邏輯，找答案的效率會很低。但隨著功力提升，會越容易知道問題的癥結在哪，找答案 (或是確認問題能否被解決) 也會變得更有效率。&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:17" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:18">
&lt;p>swirl 是 R 的套件，可以讓使用者直接在 R 的環境中互動式學習 R。其提供許多課程可供使用者下載，我覺得學完最基礎的課程就夠了，可以熟悉 Base R 的環境。詳細的課程見 &lt;a href="https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses#swirl-courses">swirl course&lt;/a>。&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:18" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:19">
&lt;p>我是在逛 bookdown.org 的書時，無意間發現 Blogdown 的書，可惜當時我早已用 Jekyll / GitHub Pages 架好網站。Jekyll 的使用門檻相當高，我也並未學會如何使用 (我直接用別人做好的&lt;a href="https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme">模板&lt;/a>，因此只要修改一些&lt;code>.html&lt;/code>和&lt;code>.css&lt;/code>)。反之，&lt;code>blogdown&lt;/code>支援的 &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> 並沒有 Jekyll 那麼多的限制。&lt;code>blogdown&lt;/code>同時大幅降低了架站的難度，例如，&lt;code>blogdown&lt;/code>支援的 Markdown 語法 (Pandoc Markdown) 很豐富且很適合寫部落格，因此用其寫部落格就不必理會 Jekyll 或 Hugo 等網頁產生器所支援的特定 Markdown 語法 (Jekyll 支援&lt;code>kramdown&lt;/code>、Hugo 支援&lt;code>blackfriday&lt;/code>)。&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:19" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:20">
&lt;p>大學以前，我很排斥程式 (詳見&lt;a href="https://liao961120.github.io/2017/11/26/mathematics.html">此文&lt;/a>)。後來發覺程式的實用性而開始想學程式語言。學了 R 後發現自己其實有資工魂 (雖然 CS 領域似乎不常用 R ？)，其實很喜歡程式語言、電腦等東西。&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:20" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

I was inspired by &lt;a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/">this post&lt;/a> and my interest in psychology.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have been reluctant to share my ideas with others (partly because I&amp;rsquo;m shy), but my interest in human evolution led me to realize the importance of learning and cultural transmission in our species&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>: &lt;em>A hard-working but not-so-smart student can do much better than a genius who never learns.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a not-so-smart student and have spent a large amount of time figuring out many things that turned out to be really simple while learning. I could have learned much more efficiently if someone had shared their experience with me (So that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to start by, say, proving $1+1=2$). Now, I think I have some experiences worth sharing, and people might benefit from them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="starting-a-blog-for-myself">Starting a Blog for Myself&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Probably, few or no people will read any post on my blog. But as noted in &lt;a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/advice-to-aspiring-data-scientists-start-a-blog/">the post&lt;/a> mentioned above, &lt;strong>writing posts is a great chance to practice skills and communicating about them&lt;/strong>. By sharing what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned through writing a post, I&amp;rsquo;m actually reviewing it. And by communicating about what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, I can know how well I understand the topic (thinking that you understand is different from understanding itself).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>有印象以來，我就很怕與數學有關的科目。從小到大面對數學時所遇到的挫折，造成我一想到數學，就會有負面感受。久而久之，便認為自己就是笨就是數學不好，認為這是自己最大的限制。這想法逐漸成為我的一部份，但我從未發覺，直至最近才意識到它的影響竟如此巨大。
原來我一直以來所做的許多判斷與選擇，都強烈被這想法左右
(判斷:原因):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>讀心理系還不錯: 用到的數學不多，頂多牙根咬緊紮實讀完統計學就好(但我對研究人類的興趣是無庸置疑的)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>修微乙就好: 微積分只要會操作就好，不用學太深&lt;/li>
&lt;li>修普化好了(與普物二擇一): 普物應該都是數學，我不會喜歡。&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>我自認最合適的判斷，原來只是建立在一個長久以來的直覺感受。原來我最大的限制並非不聰明也非數學不好，而是深信這些都是真的，進而 fit in 自己與其他人對&lt;em>數學不好&lt;/em>的期待。用術語來講，就是自己的&lt;strong>行為不知不覺中符合了這種數學不好的 schema&lt;/strong>。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Schema很可怕，因為它來去無蹤，在給自己冷靜判斷喜歡、適合什麼的機會之前，它就會迅速代替我們做好判斷(這領域好多數學→我數學不好→我不適合也不會喜歡這領域)，而我們甚至還以為這是最好的判斷。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>於是就一輩子與真心喜歡(但尚未發現)的東西擦肩而過。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>大一結束時，對心統這科目的不滿救了我。我很生氣花了一學年的時間讀了統計學，卻搞不清楚統計學是什麼，所以大二時，花了一年的時間去修數理統計。過程中有一點點辛苦，但比想像中的容易，更重要的是，這一年來學習的內容，使我具備能力與自信(習慣抽象的數學操作)去探索喜歡的東西。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>當發現自己的興趣無法被歸類於任何傳統心理學領域時，我不再受限於以往的&lt;strong>數學障礙&lt;/strong>，而敢跨出心理學領域去接觸其它學界的想法(當然並非所有領域都用到數學，只是我有興趣的問題，數學很可能可以提供一些想法)。雖然我很幸運地跨出以往對自己的限制，但我仍因過去對數學的排斥，每天為這後果付出代價:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>當初上大學選擇修簡單的微乙。現在我很想修一些課，但數學基礎太差無法修。&lt;/li>
&lt;li>高三放棄物理，導致自學微分方程時，常卡在物理的例子&lt;/li>
&lt;li>高一開始學C++前，就已認為自己學不會。現在想自學 1 種 general-purpose language 都擠不出時間。&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>我覺得一定有很多人和我一樣，因為認為自己很笨或數學很差而對某些事物望之卻步，因而錯失了接觸自己喜歡的東西的機會。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>數學不應該成為一塊絆腳石，但大家的想法似乎完全相反:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>我們總認為一般人不需要了解數學比較抽象的部分，這是天才的專利&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>但其實不正是因為我們不夠聰明，才要依靠數學將事情抽象化，進而看到事物間許多隱藏起來的關聯，而這些關聯才是我們最在意的東西。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>只有當我們認同了數學是天才的專利，而放棄掌握數學的機會，
數學才會成為我們追求所愛的絆腳石&lt;/p></description><category>thoughts</category><category>中文</category></item></channel></rss>
