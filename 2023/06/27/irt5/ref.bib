  abstract = {Self-efficacy, the belief in one's ability to moderate or abstain from heavy drinking and drug use, predicts outcomes following substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. The current study examined whether self-efficacy was associated with treatment outcomes in a trial of mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP), cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention (RP), and treatment as usual (TAU). We hypothesized self-efficacy would mediate the effects of treatment on substance use outcomes.}

  abstract = {It is known that the Rasch model is a special two-level hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM). This article demonstrates that the many-faceted Rasch model (MFRM) is also a special case of the two-level HGLM, with a random intercept representing examinee ability on a test, and fixed effects for the test items, judges, and possibly other facets. This perspective suggests useful modeling extensions of the MFRM. For example, in the HGLM framework it is possible to model random effects for items and judges in order to assess their stability across examinees. The MFRM can also be extended so that item difficulty and judge severity are modeled as functions of examinee characteristics (covariates), for the purposes of detecting differential item functioning and differential rater functioning. Practical illustrations of the HGLM are presented through the analysis of simulated and real judge-mediated data sets involving ordinal responses.}
